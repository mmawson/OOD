Enter a Lord from hunting, with his trainLordHuntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it goodAt the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.First HuntsmanWhy, Belman is as good as he, my lord;He cried upon it at the merest lossAnd twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:Trust me, I take him for the better dog.LordThou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,I would esteem him worth a dozen such.But sup them well and look unto them all:To-morrow I intend to hunt again.First HuntsmanI will, my lord.LordWhat's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?Second HuntsmanHe breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.LordO monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,A most delicious banquet by his bed,And brave attendants near him when he wakes,Would not the beggar then forget himself?First HuntsmanBelieve me, lord, I think he cannot choose.Second HuntsmanIt would seem strange unto him when he waked.LordEven as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.Then take him up and manage well the jest:Carry him gently to my fairest chamberAnd hang it round with all my wanton pictures:Balm his foul head in warm distilled watersAnd burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:Procure me music ready when he wakes,To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;And if he chance to speak, be ready straightAnd with a low submissive reverenceSay 'What is it your honour will command?'Let one attend him with a silver basinFull of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'Some one be ready with a costly suitAnd ask him what apparel he will wear;Another tell him of his hounds and horse,And that his lady mourns at his disease:Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;And when he says he is, say that he dreams,For he is nothing but a mighty lord.This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:It will be pastime passing excellent,If it be husbanded with modesty.First HuntsmanMy lord, I warrant you we will play our part,As he shall think by our true diligenceHe is no less than what we say he is.LordTake him up gently and to bed with him;And each one to his office when he wakes.Some bear out SLY. A trumpet soundsSirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:Exit ServingmanBelike, some noble gentleman that means,Travelling some journey, to repose him here.Re-enter ServingmanHow now! who is it?ServantAn't please your honour, playersThat offer service to your lordship.LordBid them come near.Enter PlayersNow, fellows, you are welcome.PlayersWe thank your honour.LordDo you intend to stay with me tonight?A PlayerSo please your lordship to accept our duty.LordWith all my heart. This fellow I remember,Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:I have forgot your name; but, sure, that partWas aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.A PlayerI think 'twas Soto that your honour means.Lord'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.Well, you are come to me in a happy time;The rather for I have some sport in handWherein your cunning can assist me much.There is a lord will hear you play to-night:But I am doubtful of your modesties;Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--For yet his honour never heard a play--You break into some merry passionAnd so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,If you should smile he grows impatient.A PlayerFear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,Were he the veriest antic in the world.LordGo, sirrah, take them to the buttery,And give them friendly welcome every one:Let them want nothing that my house affords.Exit one with the PlayersSirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.Tell him from me, as he will win my love,He bear himself with honourable action,Such as he hath observed in noble ladiesUnto their lords, by them accomplished:Such duty to the drunkard let him doWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,And say 'What is't your honour will command,Wherein your lady and your humble wifeMay show her duty and make known her love?'And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,And with declining head into his bosom,Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'dTo see her noble lord restored to health,Who for this seven years hath esteem'd himNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar:And if the boy have not a woman's giftTo rain a shower of commanded tears,An onion will do well for such a shift,Which in a napkin being close convey'dShall in despite enforce a watery eye.See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:Anon I'll give thee more instructions.Exit a ServingmanI know the boy will well usurp the grace,Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,And how my men will stay themselves from laughterWhen they do homage to this simple peasant.I'll in to counsel them; haply my presenceMay well abate the over-merry spleenWhich otherwise would grow into extremes.ExeuntSCENE II.

Am not I ChristopherSly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth apedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation abear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, ifshe know me not: if she say I am not fourteen penceon the score for sheer ale, score me up for thelyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am notbestraught: here's--Third ServantO, this it is that makes your lady mourn!Second ServantO, this is it that makes your servants droop!LordHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishmentAnd banish hence these abject lowly dreams.Look how thy servants do attend on thee,Each in his office ready at thy beck.Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,MusicAnd twenty caged nightingales do sing:Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couchSofter and sweeter than the lustful bedOn purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soarAbove the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer themAnd fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.First ServantSay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swiftAs breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.Second ServantDost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straightAdonis painted by a running brook,And Cytherea all in sedges hid,Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,Even as the waving sedges play with wind.LordWe'll show thee Io as she was a maid,And how she was beguiled and surprised,As lively painted as the deed was done.Third ServantOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.LordThou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:Thou hast a lady far more beautifulThan any woman in this waning age.First ServantAnd till the tears that she hath shed for theeLike envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,She was the fairest creature in the world;And yet she is inferior to none.SLYAm I a lord? and have I such a lady?Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:Upon my life, I am a lord indeedAnd not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.Second ServantWill't please your mightiness to wash your hands?O, how we joy to see your wit restored!O, that once more you knew but what you are!These fifteen years you have been in a dream;Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.SLYThese fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.But did I never speak of all that time?First ServantO, yes, my lord, but very idle words:For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;And rail upon the hostess of the house;And say you would present her at the leet,Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.SLYAy, the woman's maid of the house.Third ServantWhy, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of GreeceAnd Peter Turph and Henry PimpernellAnd twenty more such names and men as theseWhich never were nor no man ever saw.SLYNow Lord be thanked for my good amends!ALLAmen.SLYI thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.Enter the Page as a lady, with attendantsPageHow fares my noble lord?SLYMarry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.Where is my wife?PageHere, noble lord: what is thy will with her?SLYAre you my wife and will not call me husband?My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.PageMy husband and my lord, my lord and husband;I am your wife in all obedience.SLYI know it well. What must I call her?LordMadam.SLYAl'ce madam, or Joan madam?Lord'Madam,' and nothing else: so lordscall ladies.SLYMadam wife, they say that I have dream'dAnd slept above some fifteen year or more.PageAy, and the time seems thirty unto me,Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.SLY'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.Madam, undress you and come now to bed.PageThrice noble lord, let me entreat of youTo pardon me yet for a night or two,Or, if not so, until the sun be set:For your physicians have expressly charged,In peril to incur your former malady,That I should yet absent me from your bed:I hope this reason stands for my excuse.SLYAy, it stands so that I may hardlytarry so long. But I would be loath to fall intomy dreams again: I will therefore tarry indespite of the flesh and the blood.Enter a MessengerMessengerYour honour's players, heating your amendment,Are come to play a pleasant comedy;For so your doctors hold it very meet,Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:Therefore they thought it good you hear a playAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.SLYMarry, I will, let them play it. Is not acomondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?PageNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.SLYWhat, household stuff?PageIt is a kind of history.SLYWell, well see't.

If you, Hortensio,Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,Prefer them hither; for to cunning menI will be very kind, and liberalTo mine own children in good bringing up:And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;For I have more to commune with Bianca.ExitKATHARINAWhy, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, Iknew not what to take and what to leave, ha?ExitGREMIOYou may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are sogood, here's none will hold you. Their love is notso great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nailstogether, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough onboth sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear mysweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fitman to teach her that wherein she delights, I willwish him to her father.HORTENSIOSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brookedparle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,that we may yet again have access to our fairmistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, tolabour and effect one thing specially.GREMIOWhat's that, I pray?HORTENSIOMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.GREMIOA husband! a devil.HORTENSIOI say, a husband.GREMIOI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, thoughher father be very rich, any man is so very a foolto be married to hell?HORTENSIOTush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mineto endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be goodfellows in the world, an a man could light on them,would take her with all faults, and money enough.GREMIOI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry withthis condition, to be whipped at the high crossevery morning.HORTENSIOFaith, as you say, there's small choice in rottenapples. But come; since this bar in law makes usfriends, it shall be so far forth friendlymaintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughterto a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy manbe his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.How say you, Signior Gremio?GREMIOI am agreed; and would I had given him the besthorse in Padua to begin his wooing that wouldthoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid thehouse of her! Come on.Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIOTRANIOI pray, sir, tell me, is it possibleThat love should of a sudden take such hold?LUCENTIOO Tranio, till I found it to be true,I never thought it possible or likely;But see, while idly I stood looking on,I found the effect of love in idleness:And now in plainness do confess to thee,That art to me as secret and as dearAs Anna to the queen of Carthage was,Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,If I achieve not this young modest girl.Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.TRANIOMaster, it is no time to chide you now;Affection is not rated from the heart:If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'LUCENTIOGramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.TRANIOMaster, you look'd so longly on the maid,Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.LUCENTIOO yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,Such as the daughter of Agenor had,That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.TRANIOSaw you no more? mark'd you not how her sisterBegan to scold and raise up such a stormThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?LUCENTIOTranio, I saw her coral lips to moveAnd with her breath she did perfume the air:Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.TRANIONay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewdThat till the father rid his hands of her,Master, your love must live a maid at home;And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.LUCENTIOAh, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!But art thou not advised, he took some careTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?TRANIOAy, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.LUCENTIOI have it, Tranio.TRANIOMaster, for my hand,Both our inventions meet and jump in one.LUCENTIOTell me thine first.TRANIOYou will be schoolmasterAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:That's your device.LUCENTIOIt is: may it be done?TRANIONot possible; for who shall bear your part,And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,Visit his countrymen and banquet them?LUCENTIOBasta; content thee, for I have it full.We have not yet been seen in any house,Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our facesFor man or master; then it follows thus;Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,Keep house and port and servants as I should:I will some other be, some Florentine,Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at onceUncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.TRANIOSo had you need.In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,And I am tied to be obedient;For so your father charged me at our parting,'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,Although I think 'twas in another sense;I am content to be Lucentio,Because so well I love Lucentio.LUCENTIOTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:And let me be a slave, to achieve that maidWhose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.Here comes the rogue.Enter BIONDELLOSirrah, where have you been?BIONDELLOWhere have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Oryou stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?LUCENTIOSirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,And therefore frame your manners to the time.Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,Puts my apparel and my countenance on,And I for my escape have put on his;For in a quarrel since I came ashoreI kill'd a man and fear I was descried:Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,While I make way from hence to save my life:You understand me?BIONDELLOI, sir! ne'er a whit.LUCENTIOAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:Tranio is changed into Lucentio.BIONDELLOThe better for him: would I were so too!TRANIOSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I adviseYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;But in all places else your master Lucentio.LUCENTIOTranio, let's go: one thing more rests, thatthyself execute, to make one among these wooers: ifthou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both goodand weighty.ExeuntThe presenters above speakFirst ServantMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.SLYYes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:comes there any more of it?PageMy lord, 'tis but begun.SLY'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:would 'twere done!They sit and markSCENE II. Padua.

I should knockyou first,And then I know after who comes by the worst.PETRUCHIOWill it not be?Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.He wrings him by the earsGRUMIOHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.PETRUCHIONow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!Enter HORTENSIOHORTENSIOHow now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?PETRUCHIOSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.HORTENSIO'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signormio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compoundthis quarrel.GRUMIONay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.if this be not a lawful case for me to leave hisservice, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and raphim soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant touse his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I hadwell knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.PETRUCHIOA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,I bade the rascal knock upon your gateAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.GRUMIOKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not thesewords plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come younow with, 'knocking at the gate'?PETRUCHIOSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.HORTENSIOPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy galeBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?PETRUCHIOSuch wind as scatters young men through the world,To seek their fortunes farther than at homeWhere small experience grows. But in a few,Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:Antonio, my father, is deceased;And I have thrust myself into this maze,Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,And so am come abroad to see the world.HORTENSIOPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to theeAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:And yet I'll promise thee she shall be richAnd very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,And I'll not wish thee to her.PETRUCHIOSignior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as weFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou knowOne rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewdAs Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,She moves me not, or not removes, at least,Affection's edge in me, were she as roughAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;If wealthily, then happily in Padua.GRUMIONay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what hismind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him toa puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'era tooth in her head, though she have as many diseasesas two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,so money comes withal.HORTENSIOPetruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,I will continue that I broach'd in jest.I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wifeWith wealth enough and young and beauteous,Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:Her only fault, and that is faults enough,Is that she is intolerable curstAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measureThat, were my state far worser than it is,I would not wed her for a mine of gold.PETRUCHIOHortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;For I will board her, though she chide as loudAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.HORTENSIOHer father is Baptista Minola,An affable and courteous gentleman:Her name is Katharina Minola,Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.PETRUCHIOI know her father, though I know not her;And he knew my deceased father well.I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;And therefore let me be thus bold with youTo give you over at this first encounter,Unless you will accompany me thither.GRUMIOI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, shewould think scolding would do little good upon him:she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail inhis rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an shestand him but a little, he will throw a figure inher face and so disfigure her with it that sheshall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.You know him not, sir.HORTENSIOTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:He hath the jewel of my life in hold,His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,And her withholds from me and other more,Suitors to her and rivals in my love,Supposing it a thing impossible,For those defects I have before rehearsed,That ever Katharina will be woo'd;Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,That none shall have access unto BiancaTill Katharina the curst have got a husband.GRUMIOKatharina the curst!A title for a maid of all titles the worst.HORTENSIONow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,And offer me disguised in sober robesTo old Baptista as a schoolmasterWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;That so I may, by this device, at leastHave leave and leisure to make love to herAnd unsuspected court her by herself.GRUMIOHere's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,how the young folks lay their heads together!Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguisedMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?HORTENSIOPeace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.Petruchio, stand by a while.GRUMIOA proper stripling and an amorous!GREMIOO, very well; I have perused the note.Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:All books of love, see that at any hand;And see you read no other lectures to her:You understand me: over and besideSignior Baptista's liberality,I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,And let me have them very well perfumedFor she is sweeter than perfume itselfTo whom they go to.

Come on, and kiss me, Kate.LUCENTIOWell, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.VINCENTIO'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.LUCENTIOBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.PETRUCHIOCome, Kate, we'll to bed.We three are married, but you two are sped.To LUCENTIO'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;And, being a winner, God give you good night!Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINAHORTENSIONow, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.LUCENTIO'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.ExeuntACT ISCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAINFERDINANDLet fame, that all hunt after in their lives,Live register'd upon our brazen tombsAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death;When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,The endeavor of this present breath may buyThat honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edgeAnd make us heirs of all eternity.Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,That war against your own affectionsAnd the huge army of the world's desires,--Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;Our court shall be a little Academe,Still and contemplative in living art.You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,Have sworn for three years' term to live with meMy fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutesThat are recorded in this schedule here:Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,That his own hand may strike his honour downThat violates the smallest branch herein:If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.LONGAVILLEI am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bitsMake rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.DUMAINMy loving lord, Dumain is mortified:The grosser manner of these world's delightsHe throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;With all these living in philosophy.BIRONI can but say their protestation over;So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,That is, to live and study here three years.But there are other strict observances;As, not to see a woman in that term,Which I hope well is not enrolled there;And one day in a week to touch no foodAnd but one meal on every day beside,The which I hope is not enrolled there;And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,And not be seen to wink of all the day--When I was wont to think no harm all nightAnd make a dark night too of half the day--Which I hope well is not enrolled there:O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!FERDINANDYour oath is pass'd to pass away from these.BIRONLet me say no, my liege, an if you please:I only swore to study with your graceAnd stay here in your court for three years' space.LONGAVILLEYou swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.BIRONBy yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.What is the end of study? let me know.FERDINANDWhy, that to know, which else we should not know.BIRONThings hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?FERDINANDAy, that is study's godlike recompense.BIRONCome on, then; I will swear to study so,To know the thing I am forbid to know:As thus,--to study where I well may dine,When I to feast expressly am forbid;Or study where to meet some mistress fine,When mistresses from common sense are hid;Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,Study to break it and not break my troth.If study's gain be thus and this be so,Study knows that which yet it doth not know:Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.FERDINANDThese be the stops that hinder study quiteAnd train our intellects to vain delight.BIRONWhy, all delights are vain; but that most vain,Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:As, painfully to pore upon a bookTo seek the light of truth; while truth the whileDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.Study me how to please the eye indeedBy fixing it upon a fairer eye,Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heedAnd give him light that it was blinded by.Study is like the heaven's glorious sunThat will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:Small have continual plodders ever wonSave base authority from others' booksThese earthly godfathers of heaven's lightsThat give a name to every fixed starHave no more profit of their shining nightsThan those that walk and wot not what they are.Too much to know is to know nought but fame;And every godfather can give a name.FERDINANDHow well he's read, to reason against reading!DUMAINProceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!LONGAVILLEHe weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.BIRONThe spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.DUMAINHow follows that?BIRONFit in his place and time.DUMAINIn reason nothing.BIRONSomething then in rhyme.FERDINANDBiron is like an envious sneaping frost,That bites the first-born infants of the spring.BIRONWell, say I am; why should proud summer boastBefore the birds have any cause to sing?Why should I joy in any abortive birth?At Christmas I no more desire a roseThan wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;But like of each thing that in season grows.So you, to study now it is too late,Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.FERDINANDWell, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.BIRONNo, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:And though I have for barbarism spoke moreThan for that angel knowledge you can say,Yet confident I'll keep what I have sworeAnd bide the penance of each three years' day.Give me the paper; let me read the same;And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.FERDINANDHow well this yielding rescues thee from shame!BIRON[Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within amile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?LONGAVILLEFour days ago.BIRONLet's see the penalty.Reads'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?LONGAVILLEMarry, that did I.BIRONSweet lord, and why?LONGAVILLETo fright them hence with that dread penalty.BIRONA dangerous law against gentility!Reads'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a womanwithin the term of three years, he shall endure suchpublic shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'This article, my liege, yourself must break;For well you know here comes in embassyThe French king's daughter with yourself to speak--A maid of grace and complete majesty--About surrender up of AquitaineTo her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:Therefore this article is made in vain,Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.FERDINANDWhat say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.BIRONSo study evermore is overshot:While it doth study to have what it wouldIt doth forget to do the thing it should,And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.FERDINANDWe must of force dispense with this decree;She must lie here on mere necessity.BIRONNecessity will make us all forswornThree thousand times within this three years' space;For every man with his affects is born,Not by might master'd but by special grace:If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'So to the laws at large I write my name:SubscribesAnd he that breaks them in the least degreeStands in attainder of eternal shame:Suggestions are to other as to me;But I believe, although I seem so loath,I am the last that will last keep his oath.But is there no quick recreation granted?FERDINANDAy, that there is. Our court, you know, is hauntedWith a refined traveller of Spain;A man in all the world's new fashion planted,That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;One whom the music of his own vain tongueDoth ravish like enchanting harmony;A man of complements, whom right and wrongHave chose as umpire of their mutiny:This child of fancy, that Armado hight,For interim to our studies shall relateIn high-born words the worth of many a knightFrom tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;But, I protest, I love to hear him lieAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy.BIRONArmado is a most illustrious wight,A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.LONGAVILLECostard the swain and he shall be our sport;And so to study, three years is but short.Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARDDULLWhich is the duke's own person?BIRONThis, fellow: what wouldst?DULLI myself reprehend his own person, for I am hisgrace's tharborough: but I would see his own personin flesh and blood.BIRONThis is he.DULLSignior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villanyabroad: this letter will tell you more.COSTARDSir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.FERDINANDA letter from the magnificent Armado.BIRONHow low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.LONGAVILLEA high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!BIRONTo hear? or forbear laughing?LONGAVILLETo hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or toforbear both.BIRONWell, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause toclimb in the merriness.COSTARDThe matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.BIRONIn what manner?COSTARDIn manner and form following, sir; all those three:I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting withher upon the form, and taken following her into thepark; which, put together, is in manner and formfollowing. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is themanner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--in some form.BIRONFor the following, sir?COSTARDAs it shall follow in my correction: and God defendthe right!FERDINANDWill you hear this letter with attention?BIRONAs we would hear an oracle.COSTARDSuch is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.FERDINAND[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent andsole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,and body's fostering patron.'COSTARDNot a word of Costard yet.FERDINAND[Reads] 'So it is,'--COSTARDIt may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, intelling true, but so.FERDINANDPeace!COSTARDBe to me and every man that dares not fight!FERDINANDNo words!COSTARDOf other men's secrets, I beseech you.FERDINAND[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-colouredmelancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humourto the most wholesome physic of thy health-givingair; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself towalk.

I pretty, and my saying apt? orI apt, and my saying pretty?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOThou pretty, because little.MOTHLittle pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOAnd therefore apt, because quick.MOTHSpeak you this in my praise, master?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIn thy condign praise.MOTHI will praise an eel with the same praise.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOWhat, that an eel is ingenious?MOTHThat an eel is quick.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.MOTHI am answered, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI love not to be crossed.MOTH[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI have promised to study three years with the duke.MOTHYou may do it in an hour, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOImpossible.MOTHHow many is one thrice told?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.MOTHYou are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI confess both: they are both the varnish of acomplete man.MOTHThen, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum ofdeuce-ace amounts to.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIt doth amount to one more than two.MOTHWhich the base vulgar do call three.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOTrue.MOTHWhy, sir, is this such a piece of study?

If drawing my sword against the humourof affection would deliver me from the reprobatethought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, andransom him to any French courtier for a new-devisedcourtesy.

I shall be forsworn, whichis a great argument of falsehood, if I love. Andhow can that be true love which is falselyattempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson sotempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet wasSolomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.The first and second cause will not serve my turn;the passado he respects not, the duello he regardsnot: his disgrace is to be called boy; but hisglory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.

And, to humour theignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.SIR NATHANIELPerge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shallplease you to abrogate scurrility.HOLOFERNESI will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a prettypleasing pricket;Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now madesore with shooting.The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumpsfrom thicket;Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty soresone sorel.Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.SIR NATHANIELA rare talent!DULL[Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he clawshim with a talent.HOLOFERNESThis is a gift that I have, simple, simple; afoolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle ofmemory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, anddelivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But thegift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I amthankful for it.SIR NATHANIELSir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may myparishioners; for their sons are well tutored byyou, and their daughters profit very greatly underyou: you are a good member of the commonwealth.HOLOFERNESMehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shallwant no instruction; if their daughters be capable,I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui paucaloquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARDJAQUENETTAGod give you good morrow, master Parson.HOLOFERNESMaster Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should bepierced, which is the one?COSTARDMarry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.HOLOFERNESPiercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in atuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enoughfor a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.JAQUENETTAGood master Parson, be so good as read me thisletter: it was given me by Costard, and sent mefrom Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.HOLOFERNESFauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbraRuminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! Imay speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;Venetia, Venetia,Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth theenot, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?SIR NATHANIELAy, sir, and very learned.HOLOFERNESLet me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.SIR NATHANIEL[Reads]If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee likeosiers bow'd.Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,Where all those pleasures live that art wouldcomprehend:If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.HOLOFERNESYou find not the apostraphas, and so miss theaccent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here areonly numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers offancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,was this directed to you?JAQUENETTAAy, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strangequeen's lords.HOLOFERNESI will overglance the superscript: 'To thesnow-white hand of the most beauteous LadyRosaline.' I will look again on the intellect ofthe letter, for the nomination of the party writingto the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in alldesired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, thisBiron is one of the votaries with the king; and herehe hath framed a letter to a sequent of the strangerqueen's, which accidentally, or by the way ofprogression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, mysweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of theking: it may concern much. Stay not thycompliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.JAQUENETTAGood Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!COSTARDHave with thee, my girl.Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTASIR NATHANIELSir, you have done this in the fear of God, veryreligiously; and, as a certain father saith,--HOLOFERNESSir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourablecolours. But to return to the verses: did theyplease you, Sir Nathaniel?SIR NATHANIELMarvellous well for the pen.HOLOFERNESI do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupilof mine; where, if, before repast, it shall pleaseyou to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on myprivilege I have with the parents of the foresaidchild or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where Iwill prove those verses to be very unlearned,neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: Ibeseech your society.SIR NATHANIELAnd thank you too; for society, saith the text, isthe happiness of life.HOLOFERNESAnd, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.To DULLSir, I do invite you too; you shall notsay me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are attheir game, and we will to our recreation.ExeuntLOVE'S LABOURS LOSTSCENE III. The same.Enter BIRON, with a paperBIRONThe king he is hunting the deer; I am coursingmyself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling ina pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foulword. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they saythe fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: wellproved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad asAjax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:well proved again o' my side! I will not love: ifI do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but hereye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would notlove her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothingin the world but lie, and lie in my throat. Byheaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhymeand to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' mysonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sentit, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeterfool, sweetest lady!

Not by two that I know:Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.LONGAVILLEI fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:O sweet Maria, empress of my love!These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.BIRONO, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:Disfigure not his slop.LONGAVILLEThis same shall go.ReadsDid not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,Persuade my heart to this false perjury?Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.A woman I forswore; but I will prove,Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:If broken then, it is no fault of mine:If by me broke, what fool is not so wiseTo lose an oath to win a paradise?BIRONThis is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.LONGAVILLEBy whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.Steps asideBIRONAll hid, all hid; an old infant play.Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.More sacks to the mill!

Ill, to example ill,Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;For none offend where all alike do dote.LONGAVILLE[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,To be o'erheard and taken napping so.FERDINAND[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;You chide at him, offending twice as much;You do not love Maria; LongavilleDid never sonnet for her sake compile,Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwartHis loving bosom to keep down his heart.I have been closely shrouded in this bushAnd mark'd you both and for you both did blush:I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:To LONGAVILLEYou would for paradise break faith, and troth;To DUMAINAnd Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.What will Biron say when that he shall hearFaith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!For all the wealth that ever I did see,I would not have him know so much by me.BIRONNow step I forth to whip hypocrisy.AdvancingAh, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reproveThese worms for loving, that art most in love?Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tearsThere is no certain princess that appears;You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?You found his mote; the king your mote did see;But I a beam do find in each of three.O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!O me, with what strict patience have I sat,To see a king transformed to a gnat!To see great Hercules whipping a gig,And profound Solomon to tune a jig,And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?And where my liege's? all about the breast:A caudle, ho!FERDINANDToo bitter is thy jest.Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?BIRONNot you to me, but I betray'd by you:I, that am honest; I, that hold it sinTo break the vow I am engaged in;I am betray'd, by keeping companyWith men like men of inconstancy.When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?Or groan for love? or spend a minute's timeIn pruning me?

Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,At the first opening of the gorgeous east,Bows not his vassal head and strucken blindKisses the base ground with obedient breast?What peremptory eagle-sighted eyeDares look upon the heaven of her brow,That is not blinded by her majesty?FERDINANDWhat zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;She an attending star, scarce seen a light.BIRONMy eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:O, but for my love, day would turn to night!Of all complexions the cull'd sovereigntyDo meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,Where several worthies make one dignity,Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.FERDINANDBy heaven, thy love is black as ebony.BIRONIs ebony like her? O wood divine!A wife of such wood were felicity.O, who can give an oath? where is a book?That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,If that she learn not of her eye to look:No face is fair that is not full so black.FERDINANDO paradox! Black is the badge of hell,The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.BIRONDevils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,It mourns that painting and usurping hairShould ravish doters with a false aspect;And therefore is she born to make black fair.Her favour turns the fashion of the days,For native blood is counted painting now;And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.DUMAINTo look like her are chimney-sweepers black.LONGAVILLEAnd since her time are colliers counted bright.FERDINANDAnd Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.DUMAINDark needs no candles now, for dark is light.BIRONYour mistresses dare never come in rain,For fear their colours should be wash'd away.FERDINAND'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.BIRONI'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.FERDINANDNo devil will fright thee then so much as she.DUMAINI never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.LONGAVILLELook, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.BIRONO, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!DUMAINO, vile! then, as she goes, what upward liesThe street should see as she walk'd overhead.FERDINANDBut what of this? are we not all in love?BIRONNothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.FERDINANDThen leave this chat; and, good Biron, now proveOur loving lawful, and our faith not torn.DUMAINAy, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.LONGAVILLEO, some authority how to proceed;Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.DUMAINSome salve for perjury.BIRON'Tis more than need.Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.Consider what you first did swear unto,To fast, to study, and to see no woman;Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;And abstinence engenders maladies.And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,In that each of you have forsworn his book,Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,Have found the ground of study's excellenceWithout the beauty of a woman's face?From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fireWhy, universal plodding poisons upThe nimble spirits in the arteries,As motion and long-during action tiresThe sinewy vigour of the traveller.Now, for not looking on a woman's face,You have in that forsworn the use of eyesAnd study too, the causer of your vow;For where is any author in the worldTeaches such beauty as a woman's eye?Learning is but an adjunct to ourselfAnd where we are our learning likewise is:Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,Do we not likewise see our learning there?O, we have made a vow to study, lords,And in that vow we have forsworn our books.For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,In leaden contemplation have found outSuch fiery numbers as the prompting eyesOf beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;And therefore, finding barren practisers,Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,Lives not alone immured in the brain;But, with the motion of all elements,Courses as swift as thought in every power,And gives to every power a double power,Above their functions and their offices.It adds a precious seeing to the eye;A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:Love's feeling is more soft and sensibleThan are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:For valour, is not Love a Hercules,Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musicalAs bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:And when Love speaks, the voice of all the godsMakes heaven drowsy with the harmony.Never durst poet touch a pen to writeUntil his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;O, then his lines would ravish savage earsAnd plant in tyrants mild humility.From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;They are the books, the arts, the academes,That show, contain and nourish all the world:Else none at all in ought proves excellent.Then fools you were these women to forswear,Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.It is religion to be thus forsworn,For charity itself fulfills the law,And who can sever love from charity?FERDINANDSaint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!BIRONAdvance your standards, and upon them, lords;Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,In conflict that you get the sun of them.LONGAVILLENow to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?FERDINANDAnd win them too: therefore let us deviseSome entertainment for them in their tents.BIRONFirst, from the park let us conduct them thither;Then homeward every man attach the handOf his fair mistress: in the afternoonWe will with some strange pastime solace them,Such as the shortness of the time can shape;For revels, dances, masks and merry hoursForerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.FERDINANDAway, away! no time shall be omittedThat will betime, and may by us be fitted.BIRONAllons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;And justice always whirls in equal measure:Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;If so, our copper buys no better treasure.ExeuntLOVE'S LABOURS LOSTACT VSCENE I.

Now, understanding that thecurate and your sweet self are good at sucheruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as itwere, I have acquainted you withal, to the end tocrave your assistance.HOLOFERNESSir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, someshow in the posterior of this day, to be rendered byour assistants, at the king's command, and this mostgallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, beforethe princess; I say none so fit as to present theNine Worthies.SIR NATHANIELWhere will you find men worthy enough to present them?HOLOFERNESJoshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his greatlimb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; thepage, Hercules,--DONADRIANO DE ARMADOPardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough forthat Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.HOLOFERNESShall I have audience? he shall present Hercules inminority: his enter and exit shall be strangling asnake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.MOTHAn excellent device! so, if any of the audiencehiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thoucrushest the snake!' that is the way to make anoffence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOFor the rest of the Worthies?--HOLOFERNESI will play three myself.MOTHThrice-worthy gentleman!DONADRIANO DE ARMADOShall I tell you a thing?HOLOFERNESWe attend.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOWe will have, if this fadge not, an antique.

The same.Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIAPRINCESSSweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,If fairings come thus plentifully in:A lady wall'd about with diamonds!Look you what I have from the loving king.ROSALINEMadame, came nothing else along with that?PRINCESSNothing but this! yes, as much love in rhymeAs would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.ROSALINEThat was the way to make his godhead wax,For he hath been five thousand years a boy.KATHARINEAy, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.ROSALINEYou'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.KATHARINEHe made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;And so she died: had she been light, like you,Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:And so may you; for a light heart lives long.ROSALINEWhat's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?KATHARINEA light condition in a beauty dark.ROSALINEWe need more light to find your meaning out.KATHARINEYou'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.ROSALINELook what you do, you do it still i' the dark.KATHARINESo do not you, for you are a light wench.ROSALINEIndeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.KATHARINEYou weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.ROSALINEGreat reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'PRINCESSWell bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.But Rosaline, you have a favour too:Who sent it? and what is it?ROSALINEI would you knew:An if my face were but as fair as yours,My favour were as great; be witness this.Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,I were the fairest goddess on the ground:I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!PRINCESSAny thing like?ROSALINEMuch in the letters; nothing in the praise.PRINCESSBeauteous as ink; a good conclusion.KATHARINEFair as a text B in a copy-book.ROSALINE'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,My red dominical, my golden letter:O, that your face were not so full of O's!KATHARINEA pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.PRINCESSBut, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?KATHARINEMadam, this glove.PRINCESSDid he not send you twain?KATHARINEYes, madam, and moreoverSome thousand verses of a faithful lover,A huge translation of hypocrisy,Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.MARIAThis and these pearls to me sent Longaville:The letter is too long by half a mile.PRINCESSI think no less. Dost thou not wish in heartThe chain were longer and the letter short?MARIAAy, or I would these hands might never part.PRINCESSWe are wise girls to mock our lovers so.ROSALINEThey are worse fools to purchase mocking so.That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:O that I knew he were but in by the week!How I would make him fawn and beg and seekAnd wait the season and observe the timesAnd spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymesAnd shape his service wholly to my hestsAnd make him proud to make me proud that jests!So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his stateThat he should be my fool and I his fate.PRINCESSNone are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of schoolAnd wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.ROSALINEThe blood of youth burns not with such excessAs gravity's revolt to wantonness.MARIAFolly in fools bears not so strong a noteAs foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;Since all the power thereof it doth applyTo prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.PRINCESSHere comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.Enter BOYETBOYETO, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?PRINCESSThy news Boyet?BOYETPrepare, madam, prepare!Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted areAgainst your peace: Love doth approach disguised,Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.PRINCESSSaint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are theyThat charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.BOYETUnder the cool shade of a sycamoreI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,Toward that shade I might behold addrestThe king and his companions: warilyI stole into a neighbour thicket by,And overheard what you shall overhear,That, by and by, disguised they will be here.Their herald is a pretty knavish page,That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:Action and accent did they teach him there;'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'And ever and anon they made a doubtPresence majestical would put him out,'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and sworeA better speech was never spoke before;Another, with his finger and his thumb,Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.With that, they all did tumble on the ground,With such a zealous laughter, so profound,That in this spleen ridiculous appears,To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.PRINCESSBut what, but what, come they to visit us?BOYETThey do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;And every one his love-feat will advanceUnto his several mistress, which they'll knowBy favours several which they did bestow.PRINCESSAnd will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;And not a man of them shall have the grace,Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,And then the king will court thee for his dear;Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.And change your favours too; so shall your lovesWoo contrary, deceived by these removes.ROSALINECome on, then; wear the favours most in sight.KATHARINEBut in this changing what is your intent?PRINCESSThe effect of my intent is to cross theirs:They do it but in mocking merriment;And mock for mock is only my intent.Their several counsels they unbosom shallTo loves mistook, and so be mock'd withalUpon the next occasion that we meet,With visages displayed, to talk and greet.ROSALINEBut shall we dance, if they desire to't?PRINCESSNo, to the death, we will not move a foot;Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.BOYETWhy, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,And quite divorce his memory from his part.PRINCESSTherefore I do it; and I make no doubtThe rest will ne'er come in, if he be outThere's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:So shall we stay, mocking intended game,And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.Trumpets sound withinBOYETThe trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.The Ladies maskEnter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and maskedMOTHAll hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--BOYETBeauties no richer than rich taffeta.MOTHA holy parcel of the fairest dames.The Ladies turn their backs to himThat ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!BIRON[Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!MOTHThat ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--BOYETTrue; out indeed.MOTHOut of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafeNot to behold--BIRON[Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.MOTHOnce to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,--with your sun-beamed eyes--BOYETThey will not answer to that epithet;You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'MOTHThey do not mark me, and that brings me out.BIRONIs this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!Exit MOTHROSALINEWhat would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:That some plain man recount their purposesKnow what they would.BOYETWhat would you with the princess?BIRONNothing but peace and gentle visitation.ROSALINEWhat would they, say they?BOYETNothing but peace and gentle visitation.ROSALINEWhy, that they have; and bid them so be gone.BOYETShe says, you have it, and you may be gone.FERDINANDSay to her, we have measured many milesTo tread a measure with her on this grass.BOYETThey say, that they have measured many a mileTo tread a measure with you on this grass.ROSALINEIt is not so. Ask them how many inchesIs in one mile: if they have measured many,The measure then of one is easily told.BOYETIf to come hither you have measured miles,And many miles, the princess bids you tellHow many inches doth fill up one mile.BIRONTell her, we measure them by weary steps.BOYETShe hears herself.ROSALINEHow many weary steps,Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,Are number'd in the travel of one mile?BIRONWe number nothing that we spend for you:Our duty is so rich, so infinite,That we may do it still without accompt.Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,That we, like savages, may worship it.ROSALINEMy face is but a moon, and clouded too.FERDINANDBlessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.ROSALINEO vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.FERDINANDThen, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.ROSALINEPlay, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.Music playsNot yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.FERDINANDWill you not dance? How come you thus estranged?ROSALINEYou took the moon at full, but now she's changed.FERDINANDYet still she is the moon, and I the man.The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.ROSALINEOur ears vouchsafe it.FERDINANDBut your legs should do it.ROSALINESince you are strangers and come here by chance,We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.FERDINANDWhy take we hands, then?ROSALINEOnly to part friends:Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.FERDINANDMore measure of this measure; be not nice.ROSALINEWe can afford no more at such a price.FERDINANDPrize you yourselves: what buys your company?ROSALINEYour absence only.FERDINANDThat can never be.ROSALINEThen cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;Twice to your visor, and half once to you.FERDINANDIf you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.ROSALINEIn private, then.FERDINANDI am best pleased with that.They converse apartBIRONWhite-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.PRINCESSHoney, and milk, and sugar; there is three.BIRONNay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!There's half-a-dozen sweets.PRINCESSSeventh sweet, adieu:Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.BIRONOne word in secret.PRINCESSLet it not be sweet.BIRONThou grievest my gall.PRINCESSGall! bitter.BIRONTherefore meet.They converse apartDUMAINWill you vouchsafe with me to change a word?MARIAName it.DUMAINFair lady,--MARIASay you so?

What shall we do,If they return in their own shapes to woo?ROSALINEGood madam, if by me you'll be advised,Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:Let us complain to them what fools were here,Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;And wonder what they were and to what endTheir shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'dAnd their rough carriage so ridiculous,Should be presented at our tent to us.BOYETLadies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.PRINCESSWhip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIARe-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habitsFERDINANDFair sir, God save you!

Russians!PRINCESSAy, in truth, my lord;Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.ROSALINEMadam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:My lady, to the manner of the days,In courtesy gives undeserving praise.We four indeed confronted were with fourIn Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,They did not bless us with one happy word.I dare not call them fools; but this I think,When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.BIRONThis jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,By light we lose light: your capacityIs of that nature that to your huge storeWise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.ROSALINEThis proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--BIRONI am a fool, and full of poverty.ROSALINEBut that you take what doth to you belong,It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.BIRONO, I am yours, and all that I possess!ROSALINEAll the fool mine?BIRONI cannot give you less.ROSALINEWhich of the vizards was it that you wore?BIRONWhere? when? what vizard? why demand you this?ROSALINEThere, then, that vizard; that superfluous caseThat hid the worse and show'd the better face.FERDINANDWe are descried; they'll mock us now downright.DUMAINLet us confess and turn it to a jest.PRINCESSAmazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?ROSALINEHelp, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.BIRONThus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.Can any face of brass hold longer out?Here stand Ilady, dart thy skill at me;Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;And I will wish thee never more to dance,Nor never more in Russian habit wait.O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,Nor never come in vizard to my friend,Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,Figures pedantical; these summer-fliesHave blown me full of maggot ostentation:I do forswear them; and I here protest,By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'dIn russet yeas and honest kersey noes:And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.ROSALINESans sans, I pray you.BIRONYet I have a trickOf the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;They are infected; in their hearts it lies;They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;These lords are visited; you are not free,For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.PRINCESSNo, they are free that gave these tokens to us.BIRONOur states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.ROSALINEIt is not so; for how can this be true,That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?BIRONPeace! for I will not have to do with you.ROSALINENor shall not, if I do as I intend.BIRONSpeak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.FERDINANDTeach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgressionSome fair excuse.PRINCESSThe fairest is confession.Were not you here but even now disguised?FERDINANDMadam, I was.PRINCESSAnd were you well advised?FERDINANDI was, fair madam.PRINCESSWhen you then were here,What did you whisper in your lady's ear?FERDINANDThat more than all the world I did respect her.PRINCESSWhen she shall challenge this, you will reject her.FERDINANDUpon mine honour, no.PRINCESSPeace, peace! forbear:Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.FERDINANDDespise me, when I break this oath of mine.PRINCESSI will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,What did the Russian whisper in your ear?ROSALINEMadam, he swore that he did hold me dearAs precious eyesight, and did value meAbove this world; adding thereto moreoverThat he would wed me, or else die my lover.PRINCESSGod give thee joy of him! the noble lordMost honourably doth unhold his word.FERDINANDWhat mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,I never swore this lady such an oath.ROSALINEBy heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.FERDINANDMy faith and this the princess I did give:I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.PRINCESSPardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.What, will you have me, or your pearl again?BIRONNeither of either; I remit both twain.I see the trick on't: here was a consent,Knowing aforehand of our merriment,To dash it like a Christmas comedy:Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trickTo make my lady laugh when she's disposed,Told our intents before; which once disclosed,The ladies did change favours: and then we,Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.Now, to our perjury to add more terror,We are again forsworn, in will and error.Much upon this it is: and might not youTo BOYETForestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,And laugh upon the apple of her eye?And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.You leer upon me, do you? there's an eyeWounds like a leaden sword.BOYETFull merrilyHath this brave manage, this career, been run.BIRONLo, he is tilting straight!

I thank you, gracious lords,For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafeIn your rich wisdom to excuse or hideThe liberal opposition of our spirits,If over-boldly we have borne ourselvesIn the converse of breath: your gentlenessWas guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:Excuse me so, coming too short of thanksFor my great suit so easily obtain'd.FERDINANDThe extreme parts of time extremely formsAll causes to the purpose of his speed,And often at his very loose decidesThat which long process could not arbitrate:And though the mourning brow of progenyForbid the smiling courtesy of loveThe holy suit which fain it would convince,Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,Let not the cloud of sorrow justle itFrom what it purposed; since, to wail friends lostIs not by much so wholesome-profitableAs to rejoice at friends but newly found.PRINCESSI understand you not: my griefs are double.BIRONHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;And by these badges understand the king.For your fair sakes have we neglected time,Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humoursEven to the opposed end of our intents:And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--As love is full of unbefitting strains,All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,Varying in subjects as the eye doth rollTo every varied object in his glance:Which parti-coated presence of loose lovePut on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,Our love being yours, the error that love makesIs likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,By being once false for ever to be trueTo those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.PRINCESSWe have received your letters full of love;Your favours, the ambassadors of love;And, in our maiden council, rated themAt courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,As bombast and as lining to the time:But more devout than this in our respectsHave we not been; and therefore met your lovesIn their own fashion, like a merriment.DUMAINOur letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.LONGAVILLESo did our looks.ROSALINEWe did not quote them so.FERDINANDNow, at the latest minute of the hour,Grant us your loves.PRINCESSA time, methinks, too shortTo make a world-without-end bargain in.No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:If for my love, as there is no such cause,You will do aught, this shall you do for me:Your oath I will not trust; but go with speedTo some forlorn and naked hermitage,Remote from all the pleasures of the world;There stay until the twelve celestial signsHave brought about the annual reckoning.If this austere insociable lifeChange not your offer made in heat of blood;If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weedsNip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,But that it bear this trial and last love;Then, at the expiration of the year,Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,And, by this virgin palm now kissing thineI will be thine; and till that instant shutMy woeful self up in a mourning house,Raining the tears of lamentationFor the remembrance of my father's death.If this thou do deny, let our hands part,Neither entitled in the other's heart.FERDINANDIf this, or more than this, I would deny,To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.DUMAINBut what to me, my love? but what to me?

Sweet Valentine, adieu!Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seestSome rare note-worthy object in thy travel:Wish me partaker in thy happinessWhen thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,If ever danger do environ thee,Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.VALENTINEAnd on a love-book pray for my success?PROTEUSUpon some book I love I'll pray for thee.VALENTINEThat's on some shallow story of deep love:How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.PROTEUSThat's a deep story of a deeper love:For he was more than over shoes in love.VALENTINE'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,And yet you never swum the Hellespont.PROTEUSOver the boots? nay, give me not the boots.VALENTINENo, I will not, for it boots thee not.PROTEUSWhat?VALENTINETo be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirthWith twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;If lost, why then a grievous labour won;However, but a folly bought with wit,Or else a wit by folly vanquished.PROTEUSSo, by your circumstance, you call me fool.VALENTINESo, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.PROTEUS'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.VALENTINELove is your master, for he masters you:And he that is so yoked by a fool,Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.PROTEUSYet writers say, as in the sweetest budThe eating canker dwells, so eating loveInhabits in the finest wits of all.VALENTINEAnd writers say, as the most forward budIs eaten by the canker ere it blow,Even so by love the young and tender witIs turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,Losing his verdure even in the primeAnd all the fair effects of future hopes.But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,That art a votary to fond desire?Once more adieu! my father at the roadExpects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.PROTEUSAnd thither will I bring thee, Valentine.VALENTINESweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.To Milan let me hear from thee by lettersOf thy success in love, and what news elseBetideth here in absence of thy friend;And likewise will visit thee with mine.PROTEUSAll happiness bechance to thee in Milan!VALENTINEAs much to you at home! and so, farewell.ExitPROTEUSHe after honour hunts, I after love:He leaves his friends to dignify them more,I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,War with good counsel, set the world at nought;Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.Enter SPEEDSPEEDSir Proteus, save you!

What said she?SPEEDTruly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.PROTEUSWhy, couldst thou perceive so much from her?SPEEDSir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:and being so hard to me that brought your mind, Ifear she'll prove as hard to you in telling yourmind. Give her no token but stones; for she's ashard as steel.PROTEUSWhat said she? nothing?SPEEDNo, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.'

Madam Silvia!VALENTINEHow now, sirrah?SPEEDShe is not within hearing, sir.VALENTINEWhy, sir, who bade you call her?SPEEDYour worship, sir; or else I mistook.VALENTINEWell, you'll still be too forward.SPEEDAnd yet I was last chidden for being too slow.VALENTINEGo to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?SPEEDShe that your worship loves?VALENTINEWhy, how know you that I am in love?SPEEDMarry, by these special marks: first, you havelearned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like arobin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that hadthe pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that hadlost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that hadburied her grandam; to fast, like one that takesdiet; to watch like one that fears robbing; tospeak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You werewont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when youwalked, to walk like one of the lions; when youfasted, it was presently after dinner; when youlooked sadly, it was for want of money: and now youare metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I lookon you, I can hardly think you my master.VALENTINEAre all these things perceived in me?SPEEDThey are all perceived without ye.VALENTINEWithout me? they cannot.SPEEDWithout you? nay, that's certain, for, without youwere so simple, none else would: but you are sowithout these follies, that these follies are withinyou and shine through you like the water in anurinal, that not an eye that sees you but is aphysician to comment on your malady.VALENTINEBut tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?SPEEDShe that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?VALENTINEHast thou observed that? even she, I mean.SPEEDWhy, sir, I know her not.VALENTINEDost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yetknowest her not?SPEEDIs she not hard-favoured, sir?VALENTINENot so fair, boy, as well-favoured.SPEEDSir, I know that well enough.VALENTINEWhat dost thou know?SPEEDThat she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.VALENTINEI mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.SPEEDThat's because the one is painted and the other outof all count.VALENTINEHow painted? and how out of count?SPEEDMarry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that noman counts of her beauty.VALENTINEHow esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.SPEEDYou never saw her since she was deformed.VALENTINEHow long hath she been deformed?SPEEDEver since you loved her.VALENTINEI have loved her ever since I saw her; and still Isee her beautiful.SPEEDIf you love her, you cannot see her.VALENTINEWhy?SPEEDBecause Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;or your own eyes had the lights they were wont tohave when you chid at Sir Proteus for goingungartered!VALENTINEWhat should I see then?SPEEDYour own present folly and her passing deformity:for he, being in love, could not see to garter hishose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.VALENTINEBelike, boy, then, you are in love; for lastmorning you could not see to wipe my shoes.SPEEDTrue, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,you swinged me for my love, which makes me thebolder to chide you for yours.VALENTINEIn conclusion, I stand affected to her.SPEEDI would you were set, so your affection would cease.VALENTINELast night she enjoined me to write some lines toone she loves.SPEEDAnd have you?VALENTINEI have.SPEEDAre they not lamely writ?VALENTINENo, boy, but as well as I can do them.

O exceeding puppet!Now will he interpret to her.Enter SILVIAVALENTINEMadam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.SPEED[Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.SILVIASir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.SPEED[Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.VALENTINEAs you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letterUnto the secret nameless friend of yours;Which I was much unwilling to proceed inBut for my duty to your ladyship.SILVIAI thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.VALENTINENow trust me, madam, it came hardly off;For being ignorant to whom it goesI writ at random, very doubtfully.SILVIAPerchance you think too much of so much pains?VALENTINENo, madam; so it stead you, I will writePlease you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--SILVIAA pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.SPEED[Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'VALENTINEWhat means your ladyship? do you not like it?SILVIAYes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;But since unwillingly, take them again.Nay, take them.VALENTINEMadam, they are for you.SILVIAAy, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;But I will none of them; they are for you;I would have had them writ more movingly.VALENTINEPlease you, I'll write your ladyship another.SILVIAAnd when it's writ, for my sake read it over,And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.VALENTINEIf it please me, madam, what then?SILVIAWhy, if it please you, take it for your labour:And so, good morrow, servant.ExitSPEEDO jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!My master sues to her, and she hathtaught her suitor,He being her pupil, to become her tutor.O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,That my master, being scribe, to himself should writethe letter?VALENTINEHow now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?SPEEDNay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.VALENTINETo do what?SPEEDTo be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.VALENTINETo whom?SPEEDTo yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.VALENTINEWhat figure?SPEEDBy a letter, I should say.VALENTINEWhy, she hath not writ to me?SPEEDWhat need she, when she hath made you write toyourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?VALENTINENo, believe me.SPEEDNo believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceiveher earnest?VALENTINEShe gave me none, except an angry word.SPEEDWhy, she hath given you a letter.VALENTINEThat's the letter I writ to her friend.SPEEDAnd that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.VALENTINEI would it were no worse.SPEEDI'll warrant you, 'tis as well:For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.VALENTINEI have dined.SPEEDAy, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love canfeed on the air, I am one that am nourished by myvictuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not likeyour mistress; be moved, be moved.ExeuntSCENE II. Verona.

Ihave received my proportion, like the prodigiousson, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial'scourt. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natureddog that lives: my mother weeping, my fatherwailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our catwringing her hands, and all our house in a greatperplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shedone tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, andhas no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would havewept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at myparting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. Thisshoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, thatcannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, ithath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole init, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeanceon't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is mysister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily andas small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: Iam the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am thedog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Nowcome I to my mother: O, that she could speak nowlike a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Nowcome I to my sister; mark the moan she makes.

I understand thee not.LAUNCEWhat a block art thou, that thou canst not!

But, Launce, how sayestthou, that my master is become a notable lover?LAUNCEI never knew him otherwise.SPEEDThan how?LAUNCEA notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.SPEEDWhy, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.LAUNCEWhy, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.SPEEDI tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.LAUNCEWhy, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himselfin love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth thename of a Christian.SPEEDWhy?LAUNCEBecause thou hast not so much charity in thee as togo to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?SPEEDAt thy service.ExeuntSCENE VI. The same.

Verona. JULIA'S house.Enter JULIA and LUCETTAJULIACounsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;And even in kind love I do conjure thee,Who art the table wherein all my thoughtsAre visibly character'd and engraved,To lesson me and tell me some good meanHow, with my honour, I may undertakeA journey to my loving Proteus.LUCETTAAlas, the way is wearisome and long!JULIAA true-devoted pilgrim is not wearyTo measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,And when the flight is made to one so dear,Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.LUCETTABetter forbear till Proteus make return.JULIAO, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?Pity the dearth that I have pined in,By longing for that food so long a time.Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snowAs seek to quench the fire of love with words.LUCETTAI do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,But qualify the fire's extreme rage,Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.JULIAThe more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.The current that with gentle murmur glides,Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;But when his fair course is not hindered,He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,Giving a gentle kiss to every sedgeHe overtaketh in his pilgrimage,And so by many winding nooks he straysWith willing sport to the wild ocean.Then let me go and hinder not my courseI'll be as patient as a gentle streamAnd make a pastime of each weary step,Till the last step have brought me to my love;And there I'll rest, as after much turmoilA blessed soul doth in Elysium.LUCETTABut in what habit will you go along?JULIANot like a woman; for I would preventThe loose encounters of lascivious men:Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weedsAs may beseem some well-reputed page.LUCETTAWhy, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.JULIANo, girl, I'll knit it up in silken stringsWith twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.To be fantastic may become a youthOf greater time than I shall show to be.LUCETTAWhat fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?JULIAThat fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,What compass will you wear your farthingale?'Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.LUCETTAYou must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.JULIAOut, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.LUCETTAA round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.JULIALucetta, as thou lovest me, let me haveWhat thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.But tell me, wench, how will the world repute meFor undertaking so unstaid a journey?I fear me, it will make me scandalized.LUCETTAIf you think so, then stay at home and go not.JULIANay, that I will not.LUCETTAThen never dream on infamy, but go.If Proteus like your journey when you come,No matter who's displeased when you are gone:I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.JULIAThat is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tearsAnd instances of infinite of loveWarrant me welcome to my Proteus.LUCETTAAll these are servants to deceitful men.JULIABase men, that use them to so base effect!But truer stars did govern Proteus' birthHis words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.LUCETTAPray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!JULIANow, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrongTo bear a hard opinion of his truth:Only deserve my love by loving him;And presently go with me to my chamber,To take a note of what I stand in need of,To furnish me upon my longing journey.All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,My goods, my lands, my reputation;Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.Come, answer not, but to it presently!I am impatient of my tarriance.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUSDUKESir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;We have some secrets to confer about.Exit THURIONow, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?PROTEUSMy gracious lord, that which I would discoverThe law of friendship bids me to conceal;But when I call to mind your gracious favoursDone to me, undeserving as I am,My duty pricks me on to utter thatWhich else no worldly good should draw from me.Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,This night intends to steal away your daughter:Myself am one made privy to the plot.I know you have determined to bestow herOn Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;And should she thus be stol'n away from you,It would be much vexation to your age.Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather choseTo cross my friend in his intended driftThan, by concealing it, heap on your headA pack of sorrows which would press you down,Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.DUKEProteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;Which to requite, command me while I live.This love of theirs myself have often seen,Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,And oftentimes have purposed to forbidSir Valentine her company and my court:But fearing lest my jealous aim might errAnd so unworthily disgrace the man,A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,I gave him gentle looks, thereby to findThat which thyself hast now disclosed to me.And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,The key whereof myself have ever kept;And thence she cannot be convey'd away.PROTEUSKnow, noble lord, they have devised a meanHow he her chamber-window will ascendAnd with a corded ladder fetch her down;For which the youthful lover now is goneAnd this way comes he with it presently;Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.But, good my Lord, do it so cunninglyThat my discovery be not aimed at;For love of you, not hate unto my friend,Hath made me publisher of this pretence.DUKEUpon mine honour, he shall never knowThat I had any light from thee of this.PROTEUSAdieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.ExitEnter VALENTINEDUKESir Valentine, whither away so fast?VALENTINEPlease it your grace, there is a messengerThat stays to bear my letters to my friends,And I am going to deliver them.DUKEBe they of much import?VALENTINEThe tenor of them doth but signifyMy health and happy being at your court.DUKENay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;I am to break with thee of some affairsThat touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.'Tis not unknown to thee that I have soughtTo match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.VALENTINEI know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the matchWere rich and honourable; besides, the gentlemanIs full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualitiesBeseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?DUKENo, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,Neither regarding that she is my childNor fearing me as if I were her father;And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;And, where I thought the remnant of mine ageShould have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,I now am full resolved to take a wifeAnd turn her out to who will take her in:Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;For me and my possessions she esteems not.VALENTINEWhat would your Grace have me to do in this?DUKEThere is a lady in Verona hereWhom I affect; but she is nice and coyAnd nought esteems my aged eloquence:Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--For long agone I have forgot to court;Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--How and which way I may bestow myselfTo be regarded in her sun-bright eye.VALENTINEWin her with gifts, if she respect not words:Dumb jewels often in their silent kindMore than quick words do move a woman's mind.DUKEBut she did scorn a present that I sent her.VALENTINEA woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.Send her another; never give her o'er;For scorn at first makes after-love the more.If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,But rather to beget more love in you:If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.DUKEBut she I mean is promised by her friendsUnto a youthful gentleman of worth,And kept severely from resort of men,That no man hath access by day to her.VALENTINEWhy, then, I would resort to her by night.DUKEAy, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,That no man hath recourse to her by night.VALENTINEWhat lets but one may enter at her window?DUKEHer chamber is aloft, far from the ground,And built so shelving that one cannot climb itWithout apparent hazard of his life.VALENTINEWhy then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,So bold Leander would adventure it.DUKENow, as thou art a gentleman of blood,Advise me where I may have such a ladder.VALENTINEWhen would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.DUKEThis very night; for Love is like a child,That longs for every thing that he can come by.VALENTINEBy seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.DUKEBut, hark thee; I will go to her alone:How shall I best convey the ladder thither?VALENTINEIt will be light, my lord, that you may bear itUnder a cloak that is of any length.DUKEA cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?VALENTINEAy, my good lord.DUKEThen let me see thy cloak:I'll get me one of such another length.VALENTINEWhy, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.DUKEHow shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!And here an engine fit for my proceeding.I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.Reads'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,And slaves they are to me that send them flying:O, could their master come and go as lightly,Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:While I, their king, that hither them importune,Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,Because myself do want my servants' fortune:I curse myself, for they are sent by me,That they should harbour where their lord would be.'What's here?'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.''Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly carAnd with thy daring folly burn the world?Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?Go, base intruder! overweening slave!Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,And think my patience, more than thy desert,Is privilege for thy departure hence:Thank me for this more than for all the favoursWhich all too much I have bestow'd on thee.But if thou linger in my territoriesLonger than swiftest expeditionWill give thee time to leave our royal court,By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the loveI ever bore my daughter or thyself.Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.ExitVALENTINEAnd why not death rather than living torment?To die is to be banish'd from myself;And Silvia is myself: banish'd from herIs self from self: a deadly banishment!What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?Unless it be to think that she is byAnd feed upon the shadow of perfectionExcept I be by Silvia in the night,There is no music in the nightingale;Unless I look on Silvia in the day,There is no day for me to look upon;She is my essence, and I leave to be,If I be not by her fair influenceFoster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:Tarry I here, I but attend on death:But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCEPROTEUSRun, boy, run, run, and seek him out.LAUNCESoho, soho!PROTEUSWhat seest thou?LAUNCEHim we go to find: there's not a hair on's headbut 'tis a Valentine.PROTEUSValentine?VALENTINENo.PROTEUSWho then? his spirit?VALENTINENeither.PROTEUSWhat then?VALENTINENothing.LAUNCECan nothing speak?

Friend Valentine, a word.VALENTINEMy ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.PROTEUSThen in dumb silence will I bury mine,For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.VALENTINEIs Silvia dead?PROTEUSNo, Valentine.VALENTINENo Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.Hath she forsworn me?PROTEUSNo, Valentine.VALENTINENo Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.What is your news?LAUNCESir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.PROTEUSThat thou art banished--O, that's the news!--From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.VALENTINEO, I have fed upon this woe already,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.Doth Silvia know that I am banished?PROTEUSAy, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;With them, upon her knees, her humble self;Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became themAs if but now they waxed pale for woe:But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.Besides, her intercession chafed him so,When she for thy repeal was suppliant,That to close prison he commanded her,With many bitter threats of biding there.VALENTINENo more; unless the next word that thou speak'stHave some malignant power upon my life:If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,As ending anthem of my endless dolour.PROTEUSCease to lament for that thou canst not help,And study help for that which thou lament'st.Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with thatAnd manage it against despairing thoughts.Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'dEven in the milk-white bosom of thy love.The time now serves not to expostulate:Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;And, ere I part with thee, confer at largeOf all that may concern thy love-affairs.As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,Regard thy danger, and along with me!VALENTINEI pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.PROTEUSGo, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.VALENTINEO my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUSLAUNCEI am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit tothink my master is a kind of a knave: but that'sall one, if he be but one knave. He lives not nowthat knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but ateam of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, Iwill not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tisa maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves forwages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;which is much in a bare Christian.Pulling out a paperHere is the cate-log of her condition.'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horsecan do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but onlycarry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maidwith clean hands.Enter SPEEDSPEEDHow now, Signior Launce! what news with yourmastership?LAUNCEWith my master's ship? why, it is at sea.SPEEDWell, your old vice still; mistake the word.

Is your countrymanAccording to our proclamation gone?PROTEUSGone, my good lord.DUKEMy daughter takes his going grievously.PROTEUSA little time, my lord, will kill that grief.DUKESo I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--Makes me the better to confer with thee.PROTEUSLonger than I prove loyal to your graceLet me not live to look upon your grace.DUKEThou know'st how willingly I would effectThe match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.PROTEUSI do, my lord.DUKEAnd also, I think, thou art not ignorantHow she opposes her against my willPROTEUSShe did, my lord, when Valentine was here.DUKEAy, and perversely she persevers so.What might we do to make the girl forgetThe love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?PROTEUSThe best way is to slander ValentineWith falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,Three things that women highly hold in hate.DUKEAy, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.PROTEUSAy, if his enemy deliver it:Therefore it must with circumstance be spokenBy one whom she esteemeth as his friend.DUKEThen you must undertake to slander him.PROTEUSAnd that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,Especially against his very friend.DUKEWhere your good word cannot advantage him,Your slander never can endamage him;Therefore the office is indifferent,Being entreated to it by your friend.PROTEUSYou have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do itBy ought that I can speak in his dispraise,She shall not long continue love to him.But say this weed her love from Valentine,It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.THURIOTherefore, as you unwind her love from him,Lest it should ravel and be good to none,You must provide to bottom it on me;Which must be done by praising me as muchAs you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.DUKEAnd, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,Because we know, on Valentine's report,You are already Love's firm votaryAnd cannot soon revolt and change your mind.Upon this warrant shall you have accessWhere you with Silvia may confer at large;For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;Where you may temper her by your persuasionTo hate young Valentine and love my friend.PROTEUSAs much as I can do, I will effect:But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;You must lay lime to tangle her desiresBy wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymesShould be full-fraught with serviceable vows.DUKEAy,Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.PROTEUSSay that upon the altar of her beautyYou sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:Write till your ink be dry, and with your tearsMoist it again, and frame some feeling lineThat may discover such integrity:For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,Make tigers tame and huge leviathansForsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.After your dire-lamenting elegies,Visit by night your lady's chamber-windowWith some sweet concert; to their instrumentsTune a deploring dump: the night's dead silenceWill well become such sweet-complaining grievance.This, or else nothing, will inherit her.DUKEThis discipline shows thou hast been in love.THURIOAnd thy advice this night I'll put in practise.Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,Let us into the city presentlyTo sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.I have a sonnet that will serve the turnTo give the onset to thy good advice.DUKEAbout it, gentlemen!PROTEUSWe'll wait upon your grace till after supper,And afterward determine our proceedings.DUKEEven now about it!

I was sent to deliverhim as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but hesteps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himselfin all companies! I would have, as one should say,one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not hadmore wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as Ilive, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. Hethrusts me himself into the company of three or fourgentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he hadnot been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, butall the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' saysone: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip himout' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.I, having been acquainted with the smell before,knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow thatwhips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whipthe dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do himthe more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing youwot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me outof the chamber. How many masters would do this forhis servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in thestocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he hadbeen executed; I have stood on the pillory for geesehe hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember thetrick you served me when I took my leave of MadamSilvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as Ido? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and makewater against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didstthou ever see me do such a trick?Enter PROTEUS and JULIAPROTEUSSebastian is thy name? I like thee wellAnd will employ thee in some service presently.JULIAIn what you please: I'll do what I can.PROTEUSI hope thou wilt.To LAUNCEHow now, you whoreson peasant!Where have you been these two days loitering?LAUNCEMarry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.PROTEUSAnd what says she to my little jewel?LAUNCEMarry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells youcurrish thanks is good enough for such a present.PROTEUSBut she received my dog?LAUNCENo, indeed, did she not: here have I brought himback again.PROTEUSWhat, didst thou offer her this from me?LAUNCEAy, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me bythe hangman boys in the market-place: and then Ioffered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten ofyours, and therefore the gift the greater.PROTEUSGo get thee hence, and find my dog again,Or ne'er return again into my sight.Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?Exit LAUNCEA slave, that still an end turns me to shame!Sebastian, I have entertained thee,Partly that I have need of such a youthThat can with some discretion do my business,For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,Which, if my augury deceive me not,Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.Go presently and take this ring with thee,Deliver it to Madam Silvia:She loved me well deliver'd it to me.JULIAIt seems you loved not her, to leave her token.She is dead, belike?PROTEUSNot so; I think she lives.JULIAAlas!PROTEUSWhy dost thou cry 'alas'?JULIAI cannot chooseBut pity her.PROTEUSWherefore shouldst thou pity her?JULIABecause methinks that she loved you as wellAs you do love your lady Silvia:She dreams of him that has forgot her love;You dote on her that cares not for your love.'Tis pity love should be so contrary;And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'PROTEUSWell, give her that ring and therewithalThis letter. That's her chamber. Tell my ladyI claim the promise for her heavenly picture.Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.ExitJULIAHow many women would do such a message?Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'dA fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.Alas, poor fool! why do I pity himThat with his very heart despiseth me?Because he loves her, he despiseth me;Because I love him I must pity him.This ring I gave him when he parted from me,To bind him to remember my good will;And now am I, unhappy messenger,To plead for that which I would not obtain,To carry that which I would have refused,To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.I am my master's true-confirmed love;But cannot be true servant to my master,Unless I prove false traitor to myself.Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldlyAs, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.Enter SILVIA, attendedGentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my meanTo bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.SILVIAWhat would you with her, if that I be she?JULIAIf you be she, I do entreat your patienceTo hear me speak the message I am sent on.SILVIAFrom whom?JULIAFrom my master, Sir Proteus, madam.SILVIAO, he sends you for a picture.JULIAAy, madam.SILVIAUrsula, bring my picture here.Go give your master this: tell him from me,One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.JULIAMadam, please you peruse this letter.--Pardon me, madam; I have unadvisedDeliver'd you a paper that I should not:This is the letter to your ladyship.SILVIAI pray thee, let me look on that again.JULIAIt may not be; good madam, pardon me.SILVIAThere, hold!I will not look upon your master's lines:I know they are stuff'd with protestationsAnd full of new-found oaths; which he will breakAs easily as I do tear his paper.JULIAMadam, he sends your ladyship this ring.SILVIAThe more shame for him that he sends it me;For I have heard him say a thousand timesHis Julia gave it him at his departure.Though his false finger have profaned the ring,Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.JULIAShe thanks you.SILVIAWhat say'st thou?JULIAI thank you, madam, that you tender her.Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.SILVIADost thou know her?JULIAAlmost as well as I do know myself:To think upon her woes I do protestThat I have wept a hundred several times.SILVIABelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.JULIAI think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.SILVIAIs she not passing fair?JULIAShe hath been fairer, madam, than she is:When she did think my master loved her well,She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:But since she did neglect her looking-glassAnd threw her sun-expelling mask away,The air hath starved the roses in her cheeksAnd pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,That now she is become as black as I.SILVIAHow tall was she?JULIAAbout my stature; for at Pentecost,When all our pageants of delight were play'd,Our youth got me to play the woman's part,And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,As if the garment had been made for me:Therefore I know she is about my height.And at that time I made her weep agood,For I did play a lamentable part:Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioningFor Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;Which I so lively acted with my tearsThat my poor mistress, moved therewithal,Wept bitterly; and would I might be deadIf I in thought felt not her very sorrow!SILVIAShe is beholding to thee, gentle youth.Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!I weep myself to think upon thy words.Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee thisFor thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.Farewell.Exit SILVIA, with attendantsJULIAAnd she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautifulI hope my master's suit will be but cold,Since she respects my mistress' love so much.Alas, how love can trifle with itself!Here is her picture: let me see; I think,If I had such a tire, this face of mineWere full as lovely as is this of hers:And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,Unless I flatter with myself too much.Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:If that be all the difference in his love,I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.What should it be that he respects in herBut I can make respective in myself,If this fond Love were not a blinded god?Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!And, were there sense in his idolatry,My substance should be statue in thy stead.I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyesTo make my master out of love with thee!ExitACT VSCENE I. Milan. An abbey.Enter EGLAMOUREGLAMOURThe sun begins to gild the western sky;And now it is about the very hourThat Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,Unless it be to come before their time;So much they spur their expedition.See where she comes.Enter SILVIALady, a happy evening!SILVIAAmen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:I fear I am attended by some spies.EGLAMOURFear not: the forest is not three leagues off;If we recover that, we are sure enough.ExeuntSCENE II.

Another part of the forest.Enter VALENTINEVALENTINEHow use doth breed a habit in a man!This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,And to the nightingale's complaining notesTune my distresses and record my woes.O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,Lest, growing ruinous, the building fallAnd leave no memory of what it was!Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!What halloing and what stir is this to-day?These are my mates, that make their wills their law,Have some unhappy passenger in chase.They love me well; yet I have much to doTo keep them from uncivil outrages.Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIAPROTEUSMadam, this service I have done for you,Though you respect not aught your servant doth,To hazard life and rescue you from himThat would have forced your honour and your love;Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;A smaller boon than this I cannot begAnd less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.VALENTINE[Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.SILVIAO miserable, unhappy that I am!PROTEUSUnhappy were you, madam, ere I came;But by my coming I have made you happy.SILVIABy thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.JULIA[Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.SILVIAHad I been seized by a hungry lion,I would have been a breakfast to the beast,Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!And full as much, for more there cannot be,I do detest false perjured Proteus.Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.PROTEUSWhat dangerous action, stood it next to death,Would I not undergo for one calm look!O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,When women cannot love where they're beloved!SILVIAWhen Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faithInto a thousand oaths; and all those oathsDescended into perjury, to love me.Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;And that's far worse than none; better have noneThan plural faith which is too much by one:Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!PROTEUSIn loveWho respects friend?SILVIAAll men but Proteus.PROTEUSNay, if the gentle spirit of moving wordsCan no way change you to a milder form,I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.SILVIAO heaven!PROTEUSI'll force thee yield to my desire.VALENTINERuffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,Thou friend of an ill fashion!PROTEUSValentine!VALENTINEThou common friend, that's without faith or love,For such is a friend now; treacherous man!Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eyeCould have persuaded me: now I dare not sayI have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.Who should be trusted, when one's own right handIs perjured to the bosom? Proteus,I am sorry I must never trust thee more,But count the world a stranger for thy sake.The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!PROTEUSMy shame and guilt confounds me.Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrowBe a sufficient ransom for offence,I tender 't here; I do as truly sufferAs e'er I did commit.VALENTINEThen I am paid;And once again I do receive thee honest.Who by repentance is not satisfiedIs nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:And, that my love may appear plain and free,All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.JULIAO me unhappy!SwoonsPROTEUSLook to the boy.VALENTINEWhy, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?Look up; speak.JULIAO good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ringto Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.PROTEUSWhere is that ring, boy?JULIAHere 'tis; this is it.PROTEUSHow! let me see:Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.JULIAO, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:This is the ring you sent to Silvia.PROTEUSBut how camest thou by this ring? At my departI gave this unto Julia.JULIAAnd Julia herself did give it me;And Julia herself hath brought it hither.PROTEUSHow! Julia!JULIABehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!Be thou ashamed that I have took upon meSuch an immodest raiment, if shame liveIn a disguise of love:It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,Women to change their shapes than men their minds.PROTEUSThan men their minds! 'tis true.O heaven! were manBut constant, he were perfect. That one errorFills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.What is in Silvia's face, but I may spyMore fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?VALENTINECome, come, a hand from either:Let me be blest to make this happy close;'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.PROTEUSBear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.JULIAAnd I mine.Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIOOutlawsA prize, a prize, a prize!VALENTINEForbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,Banished Valentine.DUKESir Valentine!THURIOYonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.VALENTINEThurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;Come not within the measure of my wrath;Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;Take but possession of her with a touch:I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.THURIOSir Valentine, I care not for her, I;I hold him but a fool that will endangerHis body for a girl that loves him not:I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.DUKEThe more degenerate and base art thou,To make such means for her as thou hast doneAnd leave her on such slight conditions.Now, by the honour of my ancestry,I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,And think thee worthy of an empress' love:Know then, I here forget all former griefs,Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,Thou art a gentleman and well derived;Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.VALENTINEI thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.DUKEI grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.VALENTINEThese banish'd men that I have kept withalAre men endued with worthy qualities:Forgive them what they have committed hereAnd let them be recall'd from their exile:They are reformed, civil, full of goodAnd fit for great employment, worthy lord.DUKEThou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.Come, let us go: we will include all jarsWith triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.VALENTINEAnd, as we walk along, I dare be boldWith our discourse to make your grace to smile.What think you of this page, my lord?DUKEI think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.VALENTINEI warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.DUKEWhat mean you by that saying?VALENTINEPlease you, I'll tell you as we pass along,That you will wonder what hath fortuned.Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hearThe story of your loves discovered:That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.ExeuntACT ISCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a MessengerLEONATOI learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragoncomes this night to Messina.MessengerHe is very near by this: he was not three leagues offwhen I left him.LEONATOHow many gentlemen have you lost in this action?MessengerBut few of any sort, and none of name.LEONATOA victory is twice itself when the achiever bringshome full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hathbestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.MessengerMuch deserved on his part and equally remembered byDon Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond thepromise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,the feats of a lion: he hath indeed betterbettered expectation than you must expect of me totell you how.LEONATOHe hath an uncle here in Messina will be very muchglad of it.MessengerI have already delivered him letters, and thereappears much joy in him; even so much that joy couldnot show itself modest enough without a badge ofbitterness.LEONATODid he break out into tears?MessengerIn great measure.LEONATOA kind overflow of kindness: there are no facestruer than those that are so washed. How muchbetter is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!BEATRICEI pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from thewars or no?MessengerI know none of that name, lady: there was none suchin the army of any sort.LEONATOWhat is he that you ask for, niece?HEROMy cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.MessengerO, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.BEATRICEHe set up his bills here in Messina and challengedCupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, readingthe challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challengedhim at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath hekilled and eaten in these wars? But how many hathhe killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.LEONATOFaith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.MessengerHe hath done good service, lady, in these wars.BEATRICEYou had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath anexcellent stomach.MessengerAnd a good soldier too, lady.BEATRICEAnd a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?MessengerA lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with allhonourable virtues.BEATRICEIt is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.LEONATOYou must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is akind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:they never meet but there's a skirmish of witbetween them.BEATRICEAlas! he gets nothing by that. In our lastconflict four of his five wits went halting off, andnow is the whole man governed with one: so that ifhe have wit enough to keep himself warm, let himbear it for a difference between himself and hishorse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,to be known a reasonable creature. Who is hiscompanion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.MessengerIs't possible?BEATRICEVery easily possible: he wears his faith but asthe fashion of his hat; it ever changes with thenext block.MessengerI see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.BEATRICENo; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I prayyou, who is his companion? Is there no youngsquarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?MessengerHe is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.BEATRICEO Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: heis sooner caught than the pestilence, and the takerruns presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! ifhe have caught the Benedick, it will cost him athousand pound ere a' be cured.MessengerI will hold friends with you, lady.BEATRICEDo, good friend.LEONATOYou will never run mad, niece.BEATRICENo, not till a hot January.MessengerDon Pedro is approached.Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASARDON PEDROGood Signior Leonato, you are come to meet yourtrouble: the fashion of the world is to avoidcost, and you encounter it.LEONATONever came trouble to my house in the likeness ofyour grace: for trouble being gone, comfort shouldremain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abidesand happiness takes his leave.DON PEDROYou embrace your charge too willingly. I think thisis your daughter.LEONATOHer mother hath many times told me so.BENEDICKWere you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?LEONATOSignior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.DON PEDROYou have it full, Benedick: we may guess by thiswhat you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathersherself. Be happy, lady; for you are like anhonourable father.BENEDICKIf Signior Leonato be her father, she would nothave his head on her shoulders for all Messina, aslike him as she is.BEATRICEI wonder that you will still be talking, SigniorBenedick: nobody marks you.BENEDICKWhat, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?BEATRICEIs it possible disdain should die while she hathsuch meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you comein her presence.BENEDICKThen is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain Iam loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and Iwould I could find in my heart that I had not a hardheart; for, truly, I love none.BEATRICEA dear happiness to women: they would else havebeen troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank Godand my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: Ihad rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a manswear he loves me.BENEDICKGod keep your ladyship still in that mind! so somegentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinatescratched face.BEATRICEScratching could not make it worse, an 'twere sucha face as yours were.BENEDICKWell, you are a rare parrot-teacher.BEATRICEA bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.BENEDICKI would my horse had the speed of your tongue, andso good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God'sname; I have done.BEATRICEYou always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.DON PEDROThat is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudioand Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hathinvited you all. I tell him we shall stay here atthe least a month; and he heartily prays someoccasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is nohypocrite, but prays from his heart.LEONATOIf you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.To DON JOHNLet me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled tothe prince your brother, I owe you all duty.DON JOHNI thank you: I am not of many words, but I thankyou.LEONATOPlease it your grace lead on?DON PEDROYour hand, Leonato; we will go together.Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIOCLAUDIOBenedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?BENEDICKI noted her not; but I looked on her.CLAUDIOIs she not a modest young lady?BENEDICKDo you question me, as an honest man should do, formy simple true judgment; or would you have me speakafter my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?CLAUDIONo; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.BENEDICKWhy, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a highpraise, too brown for a fair praise and too littlefor a great praise: only this commendation I canafford her, that were she other than she is, shewere unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, Ido not like her.CLAUDIOThou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell metruly how thou likest her.BENEDICKWould you buy her, that you inquire after her?CLAUDIOCan the world buy such a jewel?BENEDICKYea, and a case to put it into. But speak you thiswith a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan arare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man takeyou, to go in the song?CLAUDIOIn mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever Ilooked on.BENEDICKI can see yet without spectacles and I see no suchmatter: there's her cousin, an she were notpossessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beautyas the first of May doth the last of December. But Ihope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?CLAUDIOI would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn thecontrary, if Hero would be my wife.BENEDICKIs't come to this? In faith, hath not the worldone man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neckinto a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh awaySundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.Re-enter DON PEDRODON PEDROWhat secret hath held you here, that you followednot to Leonato's?BENEDICKI would your grace would constrain me to tell.DON PEDROI charge thee on thy allegiance.BENEDICKYou hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumbman; I would have you think so; but, on myallegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He isin love. With who? now that is your grace's part.Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato'sshort daughter.CLAUDIOIf this were so, so were it uttered.BENEDICKLike the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should beso.'CLAUDIOIf my passion change not shortly, God forbid itshould be otherwise.DON PEDROAmen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.CLAUDIOYou speak this to fetch me in, my lord.DON PEDROBy my troth, I speak my thought.CLAUDIOAnd, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.BENEDICKAnd, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.CLAUDIOThat I love her, I feel.DON PEDROThat she is worthy, I know.BENEDICKThat I neither feel how she should be loved norknow how she should be worthy, is the opinion thatfire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.DON PEDROThou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despiteof beauty.CLAUDIOAnd never could maintain his part but in the forceof his will.BENEDICKThat a woman conceived me, I thank her; that shebrought me up, I likewise give her most humblethanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in myforehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,all women shall pardon me. Because I will not dothem the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself theright to trust none; and the fine is, for the whichI may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.DON PEDROI shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.BENEDICKWith anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,not with love: prove that ever I lose more bloodwith love than I will get again with drinking, pickout mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang meup at the door of a brothel-house for the sign ofblind Cupid.DON PEDROWell, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thouwilt prove a notable argument.BENEDICKIf I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shootat me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped onthe shoulder, and called Adam.DON PEDROWell, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bulldoth bear the yoke.'BENEDICKThe savage bull may; but if ever the sensibleBenedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and setthem in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,and in such great letters as they write 'Here isgood horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'CLAUDIOIf this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.DON PEDRONay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver inVenice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.BENEDICKI look for an earthquake too, then.DON PEDROWell, you temporize with the hours. In themeantime, good Signior Benedick, repair toLeonato's: commend me to him and tell him I willnot fail him at supper; for indeed he hath madegreat preparation.BENEDICKI have almost matter enough in me for such anembassage; and so I commit you--CLAUDIOTo the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--DON PEDROThe sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.BENEDICKNay, mock not, mock not. The body of yourdiscourse is sometime guarded with fragments, andthe guards are but slightly basted on neither: ereyou flout old ends any further, examine yourconscience: and so I leave you.ExitCLAUDIOMy liege, your highness now may do me good.DON PEDROMy love is thine to teach: teach it but how,And thou shalt see how apt it is to learnAny hard lesson that may do thee good.CLAUDIOHath Leonato any son, my lord?DON PEDRONo child but Hero; she's his only heir.Dost thou affect her, Claudio?CLAUDIOO, my lord,When you went onward on this ended action,I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,That liked, but had a rougher task in handThan to drive liking to the name of love:But now I am return'd and that war-thoughtsHave left their places vacant, in their roomsCome thronging soft and delicate desires,All prompting me how fair young Hero is,Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.DON PEDROThou wilt be like a lover presentlyAnd tire the hearer with a book of words.If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,And I will break with her and with her father,And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this endThat thou began'st to twist so fine a story?CLAUDIOHow sweetly you do minister to love,That know love's grief by his complexion!But lest my liking might too sudden seem,I would have salved it with a longer treatise.DON PEDROWhat need the bridge much broader than the flood?The fairest grant is the necessity.Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,And I will fit thee with the remedy.I know we shall have revelling to-night:I will assume thy part in some disguiseAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio,And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heartAnd take her hearing prisoner with the forceAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale:Then after to her father will I break;And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.In practise let us put it presently.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meetingLEONATOHow now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?hath he provided this music?ANTONIOHe is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tellyou strange news that you yet dreamt not of.LEONATOAre they good?ANTONIOAs the event stamps them: but they have a goodcover; they show well outward. The prince and CountClaudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mineorchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved myniece your daughter and meant to acknowledge itthis night in a dance: and if he found heraccordant, he meant to take the present time by thetop and instantly break with you of it.LEONATOHath the fellow any wit that told you this?ANTONIOA good sharp fellow: I will send for him; andquestion him yourself.LEONATONo, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appearitself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,that she may be the better prepared for an answer,if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.Enter AttendantsCousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry youmercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use yourskill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.ExeuntSCENE III. The same.Enter DON JOHN and CONRADECONRADEWhat the good-year, my lord! why are you thus outof measure sad?DON JOHNThere is no measure in the occasion that breeds;therefore the sadness is without limit.CONRADEYou should hear reason.DON JOHNAnd when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?CONRADEIf not a present remedy, at least a patientsufferance.DON JOHNI wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moralmedicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hidewhat I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smileat no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and waitfor no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy andtend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry andclaw no man in his humour.CONRADEYea, but you must not make the full show of thistill you may do it without controlment. You have oflate stood out against your brother, and he hathta'en you newly into his grace; where it isimpossible you should take true root but by thefair weather that you make yourself: it is needfulthat you frame the season for your own harvest.DON JOHNI had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose inhis grace, and it better fits my blood to bedisdained of all than to fashion a carriage to roblove from any: in this, though I cannot be said tobe a flattering honest man, it must not be deniedbut I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted witha muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore Ihave decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had mymouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would domy liking: in the meantime let me be that I am andseek not to alter me.CONRADECan you make no use of your discontent?DON JOHNI make all use of it, for I use it only.Who comes here?Enter BORACHIOWhat news, Borachio?BORACHIOI came yonder from a great supper: the prince yourbrother is royally entertained by Leonato: and Ican give you intelligence of an intended marriage.DON JOHNWill it serve for any model to build mischief on?What is he for a fool that betroths himself tounquietness?BORACHIOMarry, it is your brother's right hand.DON JOHNWho? the most exquisite Claudio?BORACHIOEven he.DON JOHNA proper squire! And who, and who? which way lookshe?BORACHIOMarry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.DON JOHNA very forward March-chick! How came you to this?BORACHIOBeing entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking amusty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, handin hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind thearras; and there heard it agreed upon that theprince should woo Hero for himself, and havingobtained her, give her to Count Claudio.DON JOHNCome, come, let us thither: this may prove food tomy displeasure. That young start-up hath all theglory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, Ibless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?CONRADETo the death, my lord.DON JOHNLet us to the great supper: their cheer is thegreater that I am subdued. Would the cook were ofmy mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?BORACHIOWe'll wait upon your lordship.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and othersLEONATOWas not Count John here at supper?ANTONIOI saw him not.BEATRICEHow tartly that gentleman looks! I never can seehim but I am heart-burned an hour after.HEROHe is of a very melancholy disposition.BEATRICEHe were an excellent man that were made just in themidway between him and Benedick: the one is toolike an image and says nothing, and the other toolike my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.LEONATOThen half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John'smouth, and half Count John's melancholy in SigniorBenedick's face,--BEATRICEWith a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and moneyenough in his purse, such a man would win any womanin the world, if a' could get her good-will.LEONATOBy my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee ahusband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.ANTONIOIn faith, she's too curst.BEATRICEToo curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God'ssending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curstcow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.LEONATOSo, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.BEATRICEJust, if he send me no husband; for the whichblessing I am at him upon my knees every morning andevening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with abeard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.LEONATOYou may light on a husband that hath no beard.BEATRICEWhat should I do with him? dress him in my appareland make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath abeard is more than a youth, and he that hath nobeard is less than a man: and he that is more thana youth is not for me, and he that is less than aman, I am not for him: therefore, I will even takesixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead hisapes into hell.LEONATOWell, then, go you into hell?BEATRICENo, but to the gate; and there will the devil meetme, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, andsay 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you toheaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliverI up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for theheavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, andthere live we as merry as the day is long.ANTONIO[To HERO] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruledby your father.BEATRICEYes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsyand say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for allthat, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or elsemake another curtsy and say 'Father, as it pleaseme.'LEONATOWell, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.BEATRICENot till God make men of some other metal thanearth. Would it not grieve a woman to beovermastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to makean account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.LEONATODaughter, remember what I told you: if the princedo solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.BEATRICEThe fault will be in the music, cousin, if you benot wooed in good time: if the prince be tooimportant, tell him there is measure in every thingand so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hotand hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full asfantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as ameasure, full of state and ancientry; and then comesrepentance and, with his bad legs, falls into thecinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.LEONATOCousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.BEATRICEI have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.LEONATOThe revellers are entering, brother: make good room.All put on their masksEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, maskedDON PEDROLady, will you walk about with your friend?HEROSo you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.DON PEDROWith me in your company?HEROI may say so, when I please.DON PEDROAnd when please you to say so?HEROWhen I like your favour; for God defend the luteshould be like the case!DON PEDROMy visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.HEROWhy, then, your visor should be thatched.DON PEDROSpeak low, if you speak love.Drawing her asideBALTHASARWell, I would you did like me.MARGARETSo would not I, for your own sake; for I have manyill-qualities.BALTHASARWhich is one?MARGARETI say my prayers aloud.BALTHASARI love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.MARGARETGod match me with a good dancer!BALTHASARAmen.MARGARETAnd God keep him out of my sight when the dance isdone! Answer, clerk.BALTHASARNo more words: the clerk is answered.URSULAI know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.ANTONIOAt a word, I am not.URSULAI know you by the waggling of your head.ANTONIOTo tell you true, I counterfeit him.URSULAYou could never do him so ill-well, unless you werethe very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: youare he, you are he.ANTONIOAt a word, I am not.URSULACome, come, do you think I do not know you by yourexcellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's anend.BEATRICEWill you not tell me who told you so?BENEDICKNo, you shall pardon me.BEATRICENor will you not tell me who you are?BENEDICKNot now.BEATRICEThat I was disdainful, and that I had my good witout of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this wasSignior Benedick that said so.BENEDICKWhat's he?BEATRICEI am sure you know him well enough.BENEDICKNot I, believe me.BEATRICEDid he never make you laugh?BENEDICKI pray you, what is he?BEATRICEWhy, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:none but libertines delight in him; and thecommendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;for he both pleases men and angers them, and thenthey laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is inthe fleet: I would he had boarded me.BENEDICKWhen I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.BEATRICEDo, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,strikes him into melancholy; and then there's apartridge wing saved, for the fool will eat nosupper that night.MusicWe must follow the leaders.BENEDICKIn every good thing.BEATRICENay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them atthe next turning.Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIODON JOHNSure my brother is amorous on Hero and hathwithdrawn her father to break with him about it.The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.BORACHIOAnd that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.DON JOHNAre not you Signior Benedick?CLAUDIOYou know me well; I am he.DON JOHNSignior, you are very near my brother in his love:he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade himfrom her: she is no equal for his birth: you maydo the part of an honest man in it.CLAUDIOHow know you he loves her?DON JOHNI heard him swear his affection.BORACHIOSo did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.DON JOHNCome, let us to the banquet.Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIOCLAUDIOThus answer I in the name of Benedick,But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.Friendship is constant in all other thingsSave in the office and affairs of love:Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;Let every eye negotiate for itselfAnd trust no agent; for beauty is a witchAgainst whose charms faith melteth into blood.This is an accident of hourly proof,Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!Re-enter BENEDICKBENEDICKCount Claudio?CLAUDIOYea, the same.BENEDICKCome, will you go with me?CLAUDIOWhither?BENEDICKEven to the next willow, about your own business,county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or underyour arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wearit one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.CLAUDIOI wish him joy of her.BENEDICKWhy, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so theysell bullocks. But did you think the prince wouldhave served you thus?CLAUDIOI pray you, leave me.BENEDICKHo! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas theboy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.CLAUDIOIf it will not be, I'll leave you.ExitBENEDICKAlas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and notknow me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I gounder that title because I am merry. Yea, but so Iam apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: itis the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatricethat puts the world into her person and so gives meout. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.Re-enter DON PEDRODON PEDRONow, signior, where's the count? did you see him?BENEDICKTroth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in awarren: I told him, and I think I told him true,that your grace had got the good will of this younglady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, orto bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.DON PEDROTo be whipped! What's his fault?BENEDICKThe flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, beingoverjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it hiscompanion, and he steals it.DON PEDROWilt thou make a trust a transgression? Thetransgression is in the stealer.BENEDICKYet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,and the garland too; for the garland he might haveworn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed onyou, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.DON PEDROI will but teach them to sing, and restore them tothe owner.BENEDICKIf their singing answer your saying, by my faith,you say honestly.DON PEDROThe Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: thegentleman that danced with her told her she is muchwronged by you.BENEDICKO, she misused me past the endurance of a block!an oak but with one green leaf on it would haveanswered her; my very visor began to assume life andscold with her. She told me, not thinking I had beenmyself, that I was the prince's jester, that I wasduller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jestwith such impossible conveyance upon me that I stoodlike a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting atme. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,there were no living near her; she would infect tothe north star. I would not marry her, though shewere endowed with all that Adam bad left him beforehe transgressed: she would have made Hercules haveturned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to makethe fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall findher the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to Godsome scholar would conjure her; for certainly, whileshe is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in asanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because theywould go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horrorand perturbation follows her.DON PEDROLook, here she comes.Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATOBENEDICKWill your grace command me any service to theworld's end? I will go on the slightest errand nowto the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from thefurthest inch of Asia, bring you the length ofPrester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the greatCham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,rather than hold three words' conference with thisharpy. You have no employment for me?DON PEDRONone, but to desire your good company.BENEDICKO God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannotendure my Lady Tongue.ExitDON PEDROCome, lady, come; you have lost the heart ofSignior Benedick.BEATRICEIndeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gavehim use for it, a double heart for his single one:marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.DON PEDROYou have put him down, lady, you have put him down.BEATRICESo I would not he should do me, my lord, lest Ishould prove the mother of fools. I have broughtCount Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.DON PEDROWhy, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?CLAUDIONot sad, my lord.DON PEDROHow then? sick?CLAUDIONeither, my lord.BEATRICEThe count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, norwell; but civil count, civil as an orange, andsomething of that jealous complexion.DON PEDROI' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit isfalse. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, andfair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,and his good will obtained: name the day ofmarriage, and God give thee joy!LEONATOCount, take of me my daughter, and with her myfortunes: his grace hath made the match, and angrace say Amen to it.BEATRICESpeak, count, 'tis your cue.CLAUDIOSilence is the perfectest herald of joy: I werebut little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, asyou are mine, I am yours: I give away myself foryou and dote upon the exchange.BEATRICESpeak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouthwith a kiss, and let not him speak neither.DON PEDROIn faith, lady, you have a merry heart.BEATRICEYea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps onthe windy side of care. My cousin tells him in hisear that he is in her heart.CLAUDIOAnd so she doth, cousin.BEATRICEGood Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to theworld but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in acorner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!DON PEDROLady Beatrice, I will get you one.BEATRICEI would rather have one of your father's getting.Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Yourfather got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.DON PEDROWill you have me, lady?BEATRICENo, my lord, unless I might have another forworking-days: your grace is too costly to wearevery day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: Iwas born to speak all mirth and no matter.DON PEDROYour silence most offends me, and to be merry bestbecomes you; for, out of question, you were born ina merry hour.BEATRICENo, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then therewas a star danced, and under that was I born.Cousins, God give you joy!LEONATONiece, will you look to those things I told you of?BEATRICEI cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.ExitDON PEDROBy my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.LEONATOThere's little of the melancholy element in her, mylord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, andnot ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and wakedherself with laughing.DON PEDROShe cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.LEONATOO, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.DON PEDROShe were an excellent wife for Benedict.LEONATOO Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,they would talk themselves mad.DON PEDROCounty Claudio, when mean you to go to church?CLAUDIOTo-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till lovehave all his rites.LEONATONot till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a justseven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have allthings answer my mind.DON PEDROCome, you shake the head at so long a breathing:but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not godully by us. I will in the interim undertake one ofHercules' labours; which is, to bring SigniorBenedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain ofaffection the one with the other. I would fain haveit a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, ifyou three will but minister such assistance as Ishall give you direction.LEONATOMy lord, I am for you, though it cost me tennights' watchings.CLAUDIOAnd I, my lord.DON PEDROAnd you too, gentle Hero?HEROI will do any modest office, my lord, to help mycousin to a good husband.DON PEDROAnd Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband thatI know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noblestrain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. Iwill teach you how to humour your cousin, that sheshall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with yourtwo helps, will so practise on Benedick that, indespite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, heshall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall beours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,and I will tell you my drift.ExeuntSCENE II. The same.Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIODON JOHNIt is so; the Count Claudio shall marry thedaughter of Leonato.BORACHIOYea, my lord; but I can cross it.DON JOHNAny bar, any cross, any impediment will bemedicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,and whatsoever comes athwart his affection rangesevenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?BORACHIONot honestly, my lord; but so covertly that nodishonesty shall appear in me.DON JOHNShow me briefly how.BORACHIOI think I told your lordship a year since, how muchI am in the favour of Margaret, the waitinggentlewoman to Hero.DON JOHNI remember.BORACHIOI can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.DON JOHNWhat life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?BORACHIOThe poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you tothe prince your brother; spare not to tell him thathe hath wronged his honour in marrying the renownedClaudio--whose estimation do you mightily holdup--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.DON JOHNWhat proof shall I make of that?BORACHIOProof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for anyother issue?DON JOHNOnly to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.BORACHIOGo, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro andthe Count Claudio alone: tell them that you knowthat Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to theprince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother'shonour, who hath made this match, and his friend'sreputation, who is thus like to be cozened with thesemblance of a maid,--that you have discoveredthus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:offer them instances; which shall bear no lesslikelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term meClaudio; and bring them to see this the very nightbefore the intended wedding,--for in the meantime Iwill so fashion the matter that Hero shall beabsent,--and there shall appear such seeming truthof Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be calledassurance and all the preparation overthrown.DON JOHNGrow this to what adverse issue it can, I will putit in practise. Be cunning in the working this, andthy fee is a thousand ducats.BORACHIOBe you constant in the accusation, and my cunningshall not shame me.DON JOHNI will presently go learn their day of marriage.ExeuntSCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.Enter BENEDICKBENEDICKBoy!Enter BoyBoySignior?BENEDICKIn my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hitherto me in the orchard.BoyI am here already, sir.BENEDICKI know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.Exit BoyI do much wonder that one man, seeing how muchanother man is a fool when he dedicates hisbehaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed atsuch shallow follies in others, become the argumentof his own scorn by failing in love: and such a manis Claudio. I have known when there was no musicwith him but the drum and the fife; and now had herather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have knownwhen he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see agood armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont tospeak plain and to the purpose, like an honest manand a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; hiswords are a very fantastical banquet, just so manystrange dishes. May I be so converted and see withthese eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will notbe sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; butI'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oysterof me, he shall never make me such a fool. One womanis fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I amwell; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till allgraces be in one woman, one woman shall not come inmy grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come notnear me; noble, or not I for an angel; of gooddiscourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shallbe of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince andMonsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.WithdrawsEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATODON PEDROCome, shall we hear this music?CLAUDIOYea, my good lord. How still the evening is,As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!DON PEDROSee you where Benedick hath hid himself?CLAUDIOO, very well, my lord: the music ended,We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.Enter BALTHASAR with MusicDON PEDROCome, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.BALTHASARO, good my lord, tax not so bad a voiceTo slander music any more than once.DON PEDROIt is the witness still of excellencyTo put a strange face on his own perfection.I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.BALTHASARBecause you talk of wooing, I will sing;Since many a wooer doth commence his suitTo her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,Yet will he swear he loves.DON PEDRONow, pray thee, come;Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,Do it in notes.BALTHASARNote this before my notes;There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.DON PEDROWhy, these are very crotchets that he speaks;Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.AirBENEDICKNow, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is itnot strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls outof men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, whenall's done.The SongBALTHASARSigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,Men were deceivers ever,One foot in sea and one on shore,To one thing constant never:Then sigh not so, but let them go,And be you blithe and bonny,Converting all your sounds of woeInto Hey nonny, nonny.Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,Of dumps so dull and heavy;The fraud of men was ever so,Since summer first was leafy:Then sigh not so, & c.DON PEDROBy my troth, a good song.BALTHASARAnd an ill singer, my lord.DON PEDROHa, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.BENEDICKAn he had been a dog that should have howled thus,they would have hanged him: and I pray God his badvoice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard thenight-raven, come what plague could have come afterit.DON PEDROYea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night wewould have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.BALTHASARThe best I can, my lord.DON PEDRODo so: farewell.Exit BALTHASARCome hither, Leonato. What was it you told me ofto-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love withSignior Benedick?CLAUDIOO, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I didnever think that lady would have loved any man.LEONATONo, nor I neither; but most wonderful that sheshould so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath inall outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.BENEDICKIs't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?LEONATOBy my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to thinkof it but that she loves him with an enragedaffection: it is past the infinite of thought.DON PEDROMay be she doth but counterfeit.CLAUDIOFaith, like enough.LEONATOO God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit ofpassion came so near the life of passion as shediscovers it.DON PEDROWhy, what effects of passion shows she?CLAUDIOBait the hook well; this fish will bite.LEONATOWhat effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heardmy daughter tell you how.CLAUDIOShe did, indeed.DON PEDROHow, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have Ithought her spirit had been invincible against allassaults of affection.LEONATOI would have sworn it had, my lord; especiallyagainst Benedick.BENEDICKI should think this a gull, but that thewhite-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,sure, hide himself in such reverence.CLAUDIOHe hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.DON PEDROHath she made her affection known to Benedick?LEONATONo; and swears she never will: that's her torment.CLAUDIO'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'ShallI,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered himwith scorn, write to him that I love him?'LEONATOThis says she now when she is beginning to write tohim; for she'll be up twenty times a night, andthere will she sit in her smock till she have writ asheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.CLAUDIONow you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember apretty jest your daughter told us of.LEONATOO, when she had writ it and was reading it over, shefound Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?CLAUDIOThat.LEONATOO, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;railed at herself, that she should be so immodestto write to one that she knew would flout her; 'Imeasure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for Ishould flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though Ilove him, I should.'CLAUDIOThen down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'Osweet Benedick! God give me patience!'LEONATOShe doth indeed; my daughter says so: and theecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughteris sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrageto herself: it is very true.DON PEDROIt were good that Benedick knew of it by someother, if she will not discover it.CLAUDIOTo what end? He would make but a sport of it andtorment the poor lady worse.DON PEDROAn he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's anexcellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,she is virtuous.CLAUDIOAnd she is exceeding wise.DON PEDROIn every thing but in loving Benedick.LEONATOO, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tendera body, we have ten proofs to one that blood haththe victory. I am sorry for her, as I have justcause, being her uncle and her guardian.DON PEDROI would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I wouldhave daffed all other respects and made her halfmyself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hearwhat a' will say.LEONATOWere it good, think you?CLAUDIOHero thinks surely she will die; for she says shewill die, if he love her not, and she will die, ereshe make her love known, and she will die, if he wooher, rather than she will bate one breath of heraccustomed crossness.DON PEDROShe doth well: if she should make tender of herlove, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for theman, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.CLAUDIOHe is a very proper man.DON PEDROHe hath indeed a good outward happiness.CLAUDIOBefore God! and, in my mind, very wise.DON PEDROHe doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.CLAUDIOAnd I take him to be valiant.DON PEDROAs Hector, I assure you: and in the managing ofquarrels you may say he is wise; for either heavoids them with great discretion, or undertakesthem with a most Christian-like fear.LEONATOIf he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:if he break the peace, he ought to enter into aquarrel with fear and trembling.DON PEDROAnd so will he do; for the man doth fear God,howsoever it seems not in him by some large jestshe will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shallwe go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?CLAUDIONever tell him, my lord: let her wear it out withgood counsel.LEONATONay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.DON PEDROWell, we will hear further of it by your daughter:let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and Icould wish he would modestly examine himself, to seehow much he is unworthy so good a lady.LEONATOMy lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.CLAUDIOIf he do not dote on her upon this, I will nevertrust my expectation.DON PEDROLet there be the same net spread for her; and thatmust your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. Thesport will be, when they hold one an opinion ofanother's dotage, and no such matter: that's thescene that I would see, which will be merely adumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATOBENEDICK[Coming forward] This can be no trick: theconference was sadly borne. They have the truth ofthis from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: itseems her affections have their full bent. Love me!why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceivethe love come from her; they say too that she willrather die than give any sign of affection. I didnever think to marry: I must not seem proud: happyare they that hear their detractions and can putthem to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis atruth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tisso, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for lovingme; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, norno great argument of her folly, for I will behorribly in love with her. I may chance have someodd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,because I have railed so long against marriage: butdoth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meatin his youth that he cannot endure in his age.Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets ofthe brain awe a man from the career of his humour?No, the world must be peopled. When I said I woulddie a bachelor, I did not think I should live till Iwere married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love inher.Enter BEATRICEBEATRICEAgainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.BENEDICKFair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.BEATRICEI took no more pains for those thanks than you takepains to thank me: if it had been painful, I wouldnot have come.BENEDICKYou take pleasure then in the message?BEATRICEYea, just so much as you may take upon a knife'spoint and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,signior: fare you well.ExitBENEDICKHa! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come into dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I tookno more pains for those thanks than you took painsto thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any painsthat I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I donot take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do notlove her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.ExitACT IIISCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULAHEROGood Margaret, run thee to the parlor;There shalt thou find my cousin BeatriceProposing with the prince and Claudio:Whisper her ear and tell her, I and UrsulaWalk in the orchard and our whole discourseIs all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;And bid her steal into the pleached bower,Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,Made proud by princes, that advance their prideAgainst that power that bred it: there will she hide her,To listen our purpose. This is thy office;Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.MARGARETI'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.ExitHERONow, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,As we do trace this alley up and down,Our talk must only be of Benedick.When I do name him, let it be thy partTo praise him more than ever man did merit:My talk to thee must be how BenedickIs sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matterIs little Cupid's crafty arrow made,That only wounds by hearsay.Enter BEATRICE, behindNow begin;For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runsClose by the ground, to hear our conference.URSULAThe pleasant'st angling is to see the fishCut with her golden oars the silver stream,And greedily devour the treacherous bait:So angle we for Beatrice; who even nowIs couched in the woodbine coverture.Fear you not my part of the dialogue.HEROThen go we near her, that her ear lose nothingOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it.Approaching the bowerNo, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;I know her spirits are as coy and wildAs haggerds of the rock.URSULABut are you sureThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?HEROSo says the prince and my new-trothed lord.URSULAAnd did they bid you tell her of it, madam?HEROThey did entreat me to acquaint her of it;But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,To wish him wrestle with affection,And never to let Beatrice know of it.URSULAWhy did you so? Doth not the gentlemanDeserve as full as fortunate a bedAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon?HEROO god of love! I know he doth deserveAs much as may be yielded to a man:But Nature never framed a woman's heartOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,Misprising what they look on, and her witValues itself so highly that to herAll matter else seems weak: she cannot love,Nor take no shape nor project of affection,She is so self-endeared.URSULASure, I think so;And therefore certainly it were not goodShe knew his love, lest she make sport at it.HEROWhy, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;If low, an agate very vilely cut;If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;If silent, why, a block moved with none.So turns she every man the wrong side outAnd never gives to truth and virtue thatWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth.URSULASure, sure, such carping is not commendable.HERONo, not to be so odd and from all fashionsAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh meOut of myself, press me to death with wit.Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:It were a better death than die with mocks,Which is as bad as die with tickling.URSULAYet tell her of it: hear what she will say.HERONo; rather I will go to BenedickAnd counsel him to fight against his passion.And, truly, I'll devise some honest slandersTo stain my cousin with: one doth not knowHow much an ill word may empoison liking.URSULAO, do not do your cousin such a wrong.She cannot be so much without true judgment--Having so swift and excellent a witAs she is prized to have--as to refuseSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.HEROHe is the only man of Italy.Always excepted my dear Claudio.URSULAI pray you, be not angry with me, madam,Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,Goes foremost in report through Italy.HEROIndeed, he hath an excellent good name.URSULAHis excellence did earn it, ere he had it.When are you married, madam?HEROWhy, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counselWhich is the best to furnish me to-morrow.URSULAShe's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.HEROIf it proves so, then loving goes by haps:Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.Exeunt HERO and URSULABEATRICE[Coming forward]What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!No glory lives behind the back of such.And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite theeTo bind our loves up in a holy band;For others say thou dost deserve, and IBelieve it better than reportingly.ExitSCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S houseEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATODON PEDROI do but stay till your marriage be consummate, andthen go I toward Arragon.CLAUDIOI'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'llvouchsafe me.DON PEDRONay, that would be as great a soil in the new glossof your marriage as to show a child his new coatand forbid him to wear it. I will only be boldwith Benedick for his company; for, from the crownof his head to the sole of his foot, he is allmirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid'sbow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot athim; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and histongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks histongue speaks.BENEDICKGallants, I am not as I have been.LEONATOSo say I	methinks you are sadder.CLAUDIOI hope he be in love.DON PEDROHang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood inhim, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,he wants money.BENEDICKI have the toothache.DON PEDRODraw it.BENEDICKHang it!CLAUDIOYou must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.DON PEDROWhat! sigh for the toothache?LEONATOWhere is but a humour or a worm.BENEDICKWell, every one can master a grief but he that hasit.CLAUDIOYet say I, he is in love.DON PEDROThere is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it bea fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to bea Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in theshape of two countries at once, as, a German fromthe waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard fromthe hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancyto this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is nofool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.CLAUDIOIf he be not in love with some woman, there is nobelieving old signs: a' brushes his hat o'mornings; what should that bode?DON PEDROHath any man seen him at the barber's?CLAUDIONo, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,and the old ornament of his cheek hath alreadystuffed tennis-balls.LEONATOIndeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.DON PEDRONay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell himout by that?CLAUDIOThat's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.DON PEDROThe greatest note of it is his melancholy.CLAUDIOAnd when was he wont to wash his face?DON PEDROYea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hearwhat they say of him.CLAUDIONay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept intoa lute-string and now governed by stops.DON PEDROIndeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,conclude he is in love.CLAUDIONay, but I know who loves him.DON PEDROThat would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.CLAUDIOYes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite ofall, dies for him.DON PEDROShe shall be buried with her face upwards.BENEDICKYet is this no charm for the toothache. Oldsignior, walk aside with me: I have studied eightor nine wise words to speak to you, which thesehobby-horses must not hear.Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATODON PEDROFor my life, to break with him about Beatrice.CLAUDIO'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by thisplayed their parts with Beatrice; and then the twobears will not bite one another when they meet.Enter DON JOHNDON JOHNMy lord and brother, God save you!DON PEDROGood den, brother.DON JOHNIf your leisure served, I would speak with you.DON PEDROIn private?DON JOHNIf it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; forwhat I would speak of concerns him.DON PEDROWhat's the matter?DON JOHN[To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be marriedto-morrow?DON PEDROYou know he does.DON JOHNI know not that, when he knows what I know.CLAUDIOIf there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.DON JOHNYou may think I love you not: let that appearhereafter, and aim better at me by that I now willmanifest. For my brother, I think he holds youwell, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effectyour ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent andlabour ill bestowed.DON PEDROWhy, what's the matter?DON JOHNI came hither to tell you; and, circumstancesshortened, for she has been too long a talking of,the lady is disloyal.CLAUDIOWho, Hero?DON PEDROEven she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:CLAUDIODisloyal?DON JOHNThe word is too good to paint out her wickedness; Icould say she were worse: think you of a worsetitle, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not tillfurther warrant: go but with me to-night, you shallsee her chamber-window entered, even the nightbefore her wedding-day: if you love her then,to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honourto change your mind.CLAUDIOMay this be so?DON PEDROI will not think it.DON JOHNIf you dare not trust that you see, confess notthat you know: if you will follow me, I will showyou enough; and when you have seen more and heardmore, proceed accordingly.CLAUDIOIf I see any thing to-night why I should not marryher to-morrow in the congregation, where I shouldwed, there will I shame her.DON PEDROAnd, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will joinwith thee to disgrace her.DON JOHNI will disparage her no farther till you are mywitnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, andlet the issue show itself.DON PEDROO day untowardly turned!CLAUDIOO mischief strangely thwarting!DON JOHNO plague right well prevented! so will you say whenyou have seen the sequel.ExeuntSCENE III. A street.Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the WatchDOGBERRYAre you good men and true?VERGESYea, or else it were pity but they should suffersalvation, body and soul.DOGBERRYNay, that were a punishment too good for them, ifthey should have any allegiance in them, beingchosen for the prince's watch.VERGESWell, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.DOGBERRYFirst, who think you the most desertless man to beconstable?First WatchmanHugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they canwrite and read.DOGBERRYCome hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessedyou with a good name: to be a well-favoured man isthe gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.Second WatchmanBoth which, master constable,--DOGBERRYYou have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and makeno boast of it; and for your writing and reading,let that appear when there is no need of suchvanity. You are thought here to be the mostsenseless and fit man for the constable of thewatch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is yourcharge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you areto bid any man stand, in the prince's name.Second WatchmanHow if a' will not stand?DOGBERRYWhy, then, take no note of him, but let him go; andpresently call the rest of the watch together andthank God you are rid of a knave.VERGESIf he will not stand when he is bidden, he is noneof the prince's subjects.DOGBERRYTrue, and they are to meddle with none but theprince's subjects. You shall also make no noise inthe streets; for, for the watch to babble and totalk is most tolerable and not to be endured.WatchmanWe will rather sleep than talk: we know whatbelongs to a watch.DOGBERRYWhy, you speak like an ancient and most quietwatchman; for I cannot see how sleeping shouldoffend: only, have a care that your bills be notstolen. Well, you are to call at all theale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.WatchmanHow if they will not?DOGBERRYWhy, then, let them alone till they are sober: ifthey make you not then the better answer, you maysay they are not the men you took them for.WatchmanWell, sir.DOGBERRYIf you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtueof your office, to be no true man; and, for suchkind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,why the more is for your honesty.WatchmanIf we know him to be a thief, shall we not layhands on him?DOGBERRYTruly, by your office, you may; but I think theythat touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceableway for you, if you do take a thief, is to let himshow himself what he is and steal out of your company.VERGESYou have been always called a merciful man, partner.DOGBERRYTruly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much morea man who hath any honesty in him.VERGESIf you hear a child cry in the night, you must callto the nurse and bid her still it.WatchmanHow if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?DOGBERRYWhy, then, depart in peace, and let the child wakeher with crying; for the ewe that will not hear herlamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.VERGES'Tis very true.DOGBERRYThis is the end of the charge:--you, constable, areto present the prince's own person: if you meet theprince in the night, you may stay him.VERGESNay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.DOGBERRYFive shillings to one on't, with any man that knowsthe statutes, he may stay him: marry, not withoutthe prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch oughtto offend no man; and it is an offence to stay aman against his will.VERGESBy'r lady, I think it be so.DOGBERRYHa, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there beany matter of weight chances, call up me: keep yourfellows' counsels and your own; and good night.Come, neighbour.WatchmanWell, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit hereupon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.DOGBERRYOne word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watchabout Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding beingthere to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGESEnter BORACHIO and CONRADEBORACHIOWhat Conrade!Watchman[Aside] Peace! stir not.BORACHIOConrade, I say!CONRADEHere, man; I am at thy elbow.BORACHIOMass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would ascab follow.CONRADEI will owe thee an answer for that: and now forwardwith thy tale.BORACHIOStand thee close, then, under this pent-house, forit drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,utter all to thee.Watchman[Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.BORACHIOTherefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.CONRADEIs it possible that any villany should be so dear?BORACHIOThou shouldst rather ask if it were possible anyvillany should be so rich; for when rich villainshave need of poor ones, poor ones may make whatprice they will.CONRADEI wonder at it.BORACHIOThat shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest thatthe fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, isnothing to a man.CONRADEYes, it is apparel.BORACHIOI mean, the fashion.CONRADEYes, the fashion is the fashion.BORACHIOTush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. Butseest thou not what a deformed thief this fashionis?Watchman[Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vilethief this seven year; a' goes up and down like agentleman: I remember his name.BORACHIODidst thou not hear somebody?CONRADENo; 'twas the vane on the house.BORACHIOSeest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief thisfashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiersin the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel'spriests in the old church-window, sometime like theshaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?CONRADEAll this I see; and I see that the fashion wearsout more apparel than the man. But art not thouthyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hastshifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?BORACHIONot so, neither: but know that I have to-nightwooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by thename of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'chamber-window, bids me a thousand times goodnight,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should firsttell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,planted and placed and possessed by my master DonJohn, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.CONRADEAnd thought they Margaret was Hero?BORACHIOTwo of them did, the prince and Claudio; but thedevil my master knew she was Margaret; and partlyby his oaths, which first possessed them, partly bythe dark night, which did deceive them, but chieflyby my villany, which did confirm any slander thatDon John had made, away went Claudio enraged; sworehe would meet her, as he was appointed, next morningat the temple, and there, before the wholecongregation, shame her with what he saw o'er nightand send her home again without a husband.First WatchmanWe charge you, in the prince's name, stand!Second WatchmanCall up the right master constable. We have hererecovered the most dangerous piece of lechery thatever was known in the commonwealth.First WatchmanAnd one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'wears a lock.CONRADEMasters, masters,--Second WatchmanYou'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.CONRADEMasters,--First WatchmanNever speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.BORACHIOWe are like to prove a goodly commodity, being takenup of these men's bills.CONRADEA commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.ExeuntSCENE IV.

I saw the Duchess of Milan'sgown that they praise so.HEROO, that exceeds, they say.MARGARETBy my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect ofyours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced withsilver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellentfashion, yours is worth ten on 't.HEROGod give me joy to wear it! for my heart isexceeding heavy.MARGARET'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.HEROFie upon thee! art not ashamed?MARGARETOf what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is notmarriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lordhonourable without marriage? I think you would haveme say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and badthinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offendnobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for ahusband'? None, I think, and it be the right husbandand the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and notheavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.Enter BEATRICEHEROGood morrow, coz.BEATRICEGood morrow, sweet Hero.HEROWhy how now? do you speak in the sick tune?BEATRICEI am out of all other tune, methinks.MARGARETClap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without aburden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.BEATRICEYe light o' love, with your heels! then, if yourhusband have stables enough, you'll see he shalllack no barns.MARGARETO illegitimate construction!

Yet Benedick was such another, andnow is he become a man: he swore he would nevermarry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eatshis meat without grudging: and how you may beconverted I know not, but methinks you look withyour eyes as other women do.BEATRICEWhat pace is this that thy tongue keeps?MARGARETNot a false gallop.Re-enter URSULAURSULAMadam, withdraw: the prince, the count, SigniorBenedick, Don John, and all the gallants of thetown, are come to fetch you to church.HEROHelp to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.ExeuntSCENE V.

Well said, i' faith,neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two menride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honestsoul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as everbroke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all menare not alike; alas, good neighbour!LEONATOIndeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.DOGBERRYGifts that God gives.LEONATOI must leave you.DOGBERRYOne word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeedcomprehended two aspicious persons, and we wouldhave them this morning examined before your worship.LEONATOTake their examination yourself and bring it me: Iam now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.DOGBERRYIt shall be suffigance.LEONATODrink some wine ere you go: fare you well.Enter a MessengerMessengerMy lord, they stay for you to give your daughter toher husband.LEONATOI'll wait upon them: I am ready.Exeunt LEONATO and MessengerDOGBERRYGo, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: weare now to examination these men.VERGESAnd we must do it wisely.DOGBERRYWe will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here'sthat shall drive some of them to a non-come: onlyget the learned writer to set down ourexcommunication and meet me at the gaol.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. A church.Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and AttendantsLEONATOCome, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plainform of marriage, and you shall recount theirparticular duties afterwards.FRIAR FRANCISYou come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.CLAUDIONo.LEONATOTo be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.FRIAR FRANCISLady, you come hither to be married to this count.HEROI do.FRIAR FRANCISIf either of you know any inward impediment why youshould not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,to utter it.CLAUDIOKnow you any, Hero?HERONone, my lord.FRIAR FRANCISKnow you any, count?LEONATOI dare make his answer, none.CLAUDIOO, what men dare do! what men may do! what men dailydo, not knowing what they do!BENEDICKHow now! interjections? Why, then, some be oflaughing, as, ah, ha, he!CLAUDIOStand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:Will you with free and unconstrained soulGive me this maid, your daughter?LEONATOAs freely, son, as God did give her me.CLAUDIOAnd what have I to give you back, whose worthMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?DON PEDRONothing, unless you render her again.CLAUDIOSweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.There, Leonato, take her back again:Give not this rotten orange to your friend;She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.Behold how like a maid she blushes here!O, what authority and show of truthCan cunning sin cover itself withal!Comes not that blood as modest evidenceTo witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,All you that see her, that she were a maid,By these exterior shows? But she is none:She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.LEONATOWhat do you mean, my lord?CLAUDIONot to be married,Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.LEONATODear my lord, if you, in your own proof,Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,And made defeat of her virginity,--CLAUDIOI know what you would say: if I have known her,You will say she did embrace me as a husband,And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:No, Leonato,I never tempted her with word too large;But, as a brother to his sister, show'dBashful sincerity and comely love.HEROAnd seem'd I ever otherwise to you?CLAUDIOOut on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:You seem to me as Dian in her orb,As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;But you are more intemperate in your bloodThan Venus, or those pamper'd animalsThat rage in savage sensuality.HEROIs my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?LEONATOSweet prince, why speak not you?DON PEDROWhat should I speak?I stand dishonour'd, that have gone aboutTo link my dear friend to a common stale.LEONATOAre these things spoken, or do I but dream?DON JOHNSir, they are spoken, and these things are true.BENEDICKThis looks not like a nuptial.HEROTrue! O God!CLAUDIOLeonato, stand I here?Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?LEONATOAll this is so: but what of this, my lord?CLAUDIOLet me but move one question to your daughter;And, by that fatherly and kindly powerThat you have in her, bid her answer truly.LEONATOI charge thee do so, as thou art my child.HEROO, God defend me! how am I beset!What kind of catechising call you this?CLAUDIOTo make you answer truly to your name.HEROIs it not Hero? Who can blot that nameWith any just reproach?CLAUDIOMarry, that can Hero;Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.What man was he talk'd with you yesternightOut at your window betwixt twelve and one?Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.HEROI talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.DON PEDROWhy, then are you no maiden. Leonato,I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,Myself, my brother and this grieved countDid see her, hear her, at that hour last nightTalk with a ruffian at her chamber-windowWho hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,Confess'd the vile encounters they have hadA thousand times in secret.DON JOHNFie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,Not to be spoke of;There is not chastity enough in languageWithout offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.CLAUDIOO Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,If half thy outward graces had been placedAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,Thou pure impiety and impious purity!For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,And never shall it more be gracious.LEONATOHath no man's dagger here a point for me?HERO swoonsBEATRICEWhy, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?DON JOHNCome, let us go. These things, come thus to light,Smother her spirits up.Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIOBENEDICKHow doth the lady?BEATRICEDead, I think. Help, uncle!Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!LEONATOO Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.Death is the fairest cover for her shameThat may be wish'd for.BEATRICEHow now, cousin Hero!FRIAR FRANCISHave comfort, lady.LEONATODost thou look up?FRIAR FRANCISYea, wherefore should she not?LEONATOWherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thingCry shame upon her? Could she here denyThe story that is printed in her blood?Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?Why had I not with charitable handTook up a beggar's issue at my gates,Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,I might have said 'No part of it is mine;This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?But mine and mine I loved and mine I praisedAnd mine that I was proud on, mine so muchThat I myself was to myself not mine,Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallenInto a pit of ink, that the wide seaHath drops too few to wash her clean againAnd salt too little which may season giveTo her foul-tainted flesh!BENEDICKSir, sir, be patient.For my part, I am so attired in wonder,I know not what to say.BEATRICEO, on my soul, my cousin is belied!BENEDICKLady, were you her bedfellow last night?BEATRICENo, truly not; although, until last night,I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.LEONATOConfirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger madeWhich was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.FRIAR FRANCISHear me a little;For I have only been silent so longAnd given way unto this course of fortune....By noting of the lady I have mark'dA thousand blushing apparitionsTo start into her face, a thousand innocent shamesIn angel whiteness beat away those blushes;And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,To burn the errors that these princes holdAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a fool;Trust not my reading nor my observations,Which with experimental seal doth warrantThe tenor of my book; trust not my age,My reverence, calling, nor divinity,If this sweet lady lie not guiltless hereUnder some biting error.LEONATOFriar, it cannot be.Thou seest that all the grace that she hath leftIs that she will not add to her damnationA sin of perjury; she not denies it:Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuseThat which appears in proper nakedness?FRIAR FRANCISLady, what man is he you are accused of?HEROThey know that do accuse me; I know none:If I know more of any man aliveThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant,Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,Prove you that any man with me conversedAt hours unmeet, or that I yesternightMaintain'd the change of words with any creature,Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!FRIAR FRANCISThere is some strange misprision in the princes.BENEDICKTwo of them have the very bent of honour;And if their wisdoms be misled in this,The practise of it lives in John the bastard,Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.LEONATOI know not. If they speak but truth of her,These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,The proudest of them shall well hear of it.Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,Nor age so eat up my invention,Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,Both strength of limb and policy of mind,Ability in means and choice of friends,To quit me of them throughly.FRIAR FRANCISPause awhile,And let my counsel sway you in this case.Your daughter here the princes left for dead:Let her awhile be secretly kept in,And publish it that she is dead indeed;Maintain a mourning ostentationAnd on your family's old monumentHang mournful epitaphs and do all ritesThat appertain unto a burial.LEONATOWhat shall become of this? what will this do?FRIAR FRANCISMarry, this well carried shall on her behalfChange slander to remorse; that is some good:But not for that dream I on this strange course,But on this travail look for greater birth.She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,Upon the instant that she was accused,Shall be lamented, pitied and excusedOf every hearer: for it so falls outThat what we have we prize not to the worthWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,Why, then we rack the value, then we findThe virtue that possession would not show usWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:When he shall hear she died upon his words,The idea of her life shall sweetly creepInto his study of imagination,And every lovely organ of her lifeShall come apparell'd in more precious habit,More moving-delicate and full of life,Into the eye and prospect of his soul,Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,If ever love had interest in his liver,And wish he had not so accused her,No, though he thought his accusation true.Let this be so, and doubt not but successWill fashion the event in better shapeThan I can lay it down in likelihood.But if all aim but this be levell'd false,The supposition of the lady's deathWill quench the wonder of her infamy:And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,As best befits her wounded reputation,In some reclusive and religious life,Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.BENEDICKSignior Leonato, let the friar advise you:And though you know my inwardness and loveIs very much unto the prince and Claudio,Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in thisAs secretly and justly as your soulShould with your body.LEONATOBeing that I flow in grief,The smallest twine may lead me.FRIAR FRANCIS'Tis well consented: presently away;For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-dayPerhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICEBENEDICKLady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?BEATRICEYea, and I will weep a while longer.BENEDICKI will not desire that.BEATRICEYou have no reason; I do it freely.BENEDICKSurely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.BEATRICEAh, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!BENEDICKIs there any way to show such friendship?BEATRICEA very even way, but no such friend.BENEDICKMay a man do it?BEATRICEIt is a man's office, but not yours.BENEDICKI do love nothing in the world so well as you: isnot that strange?BEATRICEAs strange as the thing I know not. It were aspossible for me to say I loved nothing so well asyou: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; Iconfess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.BENEDICKBy my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.BEATRICEDo not swear, and eat it.BENEDICKI will swear by it that you love me; and I will makehim eat it that says I love not you.BEATRICEWill you not eat your word?BENEDICKWith no sauce that can be devised to it. I protestI love thee.BEATRICEWhy, then, God forgive me!BENEDICKWhat offence, sweet Beatrice?BEATRICEYou have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about toprotest I loved you.BENEDICKAnd do it with all thy heart.BEATRICEI love you with so much of my heart that none isleft to protest.BENEDICKCome, bid me do any thing for thee.BEATRICEKill Claudio.BENEDICKHa! not for the wide world.BEATRICEYou kill me to deny it. Farewell.BENEDICKTarry, sweet Beatrice.BEATRICEI am gone, though I am here: there is no love inyou: nay, I pray you, let me go.BENEDICKBeatrice,--BEATRICEIn faith, I will go.BENEDICKWe'll be friends first.BEATRICEYou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.BENEDICKIs Claudio thine enemy?BEATRICEIs he not approved in the height a villain, thathath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? Othat I were a man! What, bear her in hand until theycome to take hands; and then, with publicaccusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heartin the market-place.BENEDICKHear me, Beatrice,--BEATRICETalk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!BENEDICKNay, but, Beatrice,--BEATRICESweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.BENEDICKBeat--BEATRICEPrinces and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that Ihad any friend would be a man for my sake! Butmanhood is melted into courtesies, valour intocompliment, and men are only turned into tongue, andtrim ones too: he is now as valiant as Herculesthat only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be aman with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.BENEDICKTarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.BEATRICEUse it for my love some other way than swearing by it.BENEDICKThink you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?BEATRICEYea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.BENEDICKEnough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I willkiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,Claudio shall render me a dear account. As youhear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort yourcousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.ExeuntSCENE II. A prison.Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIODOGBERRYIs our whole dissembly appeared?VERGESO, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.SextonWhich be the malefactors?DOGBERRYMarry, that am I and my partner.VERGESNay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.SextonBut which are the offenders that are to beexamined? let them come before master constable.DOGBERRYYea, marry, let them come before me. What is yourname, friend?BORACHIOBorachio.DOGBERRYPray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?CONRADEI am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.DOGBERRYWrite down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, doyou serve God?CONRADE BORACHIOYea, sir, we hope.DOGBERRYWrite down, that they hope they serve God: andwrite God first; for God defend but God should gobefore such villains! Masters, it is proved alreadythat you are little better than false knaves; and itwill go near to be thought so shortly. How answeryou for yourselves?CONRADEMarry, sir, we say we are none.DOGBERRYA marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but Iwill go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; aword in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thoughtyou are false knaves.BORACHIOSir, I say to you we are none.DOGBERRYWell, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in atale. Have you writ down, that they are none?SextonMaster constable, you go not the way to examine:you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.DOGBERRYYea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watchcome forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince'sname, accuse these men.First WatchmanThis man said, sir, that Don John, the prince'sbrother, was a villain.DOGBERRYWrite down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flatperjury, to call a prince's brother villain.BORACHIOMaster constable,--DOGBERRYPray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,I promise thee.SextonWhat heard you him say else?Second WatchmanMarry, that he had received a thousand ducats ofDon John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.DOGBERRYFlat burglary as ever was committed.VERGESYea, by mass, that it is.SextonWhat else, fellow?First WatchmanAnd that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, todisgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.DOGBERRYO villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlastingredemption for this.SextonWhat else?WatchmanThis is all.SextonAnd this is more, masters, than you can deny.Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;Hero was in this manner accused, in this very mannerrefused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.Master constable, let these men be bound, andbrought to Leonato's: I will go before and showhim their examination.ExitDOGBERRYCome, let them be opinioned.VERGESLet them be in the hands--CONRADEOff, coxcomb!DOGBERRYGod's my life, where's the sexton? let him writedown the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.Thou naughty varlet!CONRADEAway! you are an ass, you are an ass.DOGBERRYDost thou not suspect my place? dost thou notsuspect my years? O that he were here to write medown an ass! But, masters, remember that I am anass; though it be not written down, yet forget notthat I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full ofpiety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,and, which is more, a householder, and, which ismore, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is inMessina, and one that knows the law, go to; and arich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hathhad losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O thatI had been writ down an ass!ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO and ANTONIOANTONIOIf you go on thus, you will kill yourself:And 'tis not wisdom thus to second griefAgainst yourself.LEONATOI pray thee, cease thy counsel,Which falls into mine ears as profitlessAs water in a sieve: give not me counsel;Nor let no comforter delight mine earBut such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.Bring me a father that so loved his child,Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,And bid him speak of patience;Measure his woe the length and breadth of mineAnd let it answer every strain for strain,As thus for thus and such a grief for such,In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunkWith candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,And I of him will gather patience.But there is no such man: for, brother, menCan counsel and speak comfort to that griefWhich they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,Their counsel turns to passion, which beforeWould give preceptial medicine to rage,Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,Charm ache with air and agony with words:No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patienceTo those that wring under the load of sorrow,But no man's virtue nor sufficiencyTo be so moral when he shall endureThe like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:My griefs cry louder than advertisement.ANTONIOTherein do men from children nothing differ.LEONATOI pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;For there was never yet philosopherThat could endure the toothache patiently,However they have writ the style of godsAnd made a push at chance and sufferance.ANTONIOYet bend not all the harm upon yourself;Make those that do offend you suffer too.LEONATOThere thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;And that shall Claudio know; so shall the princeAnd all of them that thus dishonour her.ANTONIOHere comes the prince and Claudio hastily.Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIODON PEDROGood den, good den.CLAUDIOGood day to both of you.LEONATOHear you. my lords,--DON PEDROWe have some haste, Leonato.LEONATOSome haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.DON PEDRONay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.ANTONIOIf he could right himself with quarreling,Some of us would lie low.CLAUDIOWho wrongs him?LEONATOMarry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;I fear thee not.CLAUDIOMarry, beshrew my hand,If it should give your age such cause of fear:In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.LEONATOTush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,As under privilege of age to bragWhat I have done being young, or what would doWere I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and meThat I am forced to lay my reverence byAnd, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,Do challenge thee to trial of a man.I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,And she lies buried with her ancestors;O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!CLAUDIOMy villany?LEONATOThine, Claudio; thine, I say.DON PEDROYou say not right, old man.LEONATOMy lord, my lord,I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,Despite his nice fence and his active practise,His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.CLAUDIOAway! I will not have to do with you.LEONATOCanst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.ANTONIOHe shall kill two of us, and men indeed:But that's no matter; let him kill one first;Win me and wear me; let him answer me.Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.LEONATOBrother,--ANTONIOContent yourself. God knows I loved my niece;And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,That dare as well answer a man indeedAs I dare take a serpent by the tongue:Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!LEONATOBrother Antony,--ANTONIOHold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,Go anticly, show outward hideousness,And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;And this is all.LEONATOBut, brother Antony,--ANTONIOCome, 'tis no matter:Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.DON PEDROGentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:But, on my honour, she was charged with nothingBut what was true and very full of proof.LEONATOMy lord, my lord,--DON PEDROI will not hear you.LEONATONo? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.ANTONIOAnd shall, or some of us will smart for it.Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIODON PEDROSee, see; here comes the man we went to seek.Enter BENEDICKCLAUDIONow, signior, what news?BENEDICKGood day, my lord.DON PEDROWelcome, signior: you are almost come to partalmost a fray.CLAUDIOWe had like to have had our two noses snapped offwith two old men without teeth.DON PEDROLeonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Hadwe fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.BENEDICKIn a false quarrel there is no true valour. I cameto seek you both.CLAUDIOWe have been up and down to seek thee; for we arehigh-proof melancholy and would fain have it beatenaway. Wilt thou use thy wit?BENEDICKIt is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?DON PEDRODost thou wear thy wit by thy side?CLAUDIONever any did so, though very many have been besidetheir wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do theminstrels; draw, to pleasure us.DON PEDROAs I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thousick, or angry?CLAUDIOWhat, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.BENEDICKSir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and youcharge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.CLAUDIONay, then, give him another staff: this last wasbroke cross.DON PEDROBy this light, he changes more and more: I thinkhe be angry indeed.CLAUDIOIf he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.BENEDICKShall I speak a word in your ear?CLAUDIOGod bless me from a challenge!BENEDICK[Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:I will make it good how you dare, with what youdare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I willprotest your cowardice. You have killed a sweetlady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let mehear from you.CLAUDIOWell, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.DON PEDROWhat, a feast, a feast?CLAUDIOI' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf'shead and a capon; the which if I do not carve mostcuriously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not finda woodcock too?BENEDICKSir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.DON PEDROI'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit theother day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'agreat wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.''Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'ithurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentlemanis wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.''Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That Ibelieve,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me onMonday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thusdid she, an hour together, transshape thy particularvirtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thouwast the properest man in Italy.CLAUDIOFor the which she wept heartily and said she carednot.DON PEDROYea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if shedid not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:the old man's daughter told us all.CLAUDIOAll, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he washid in the garden.DON PEDROBut when shall we set the savage bull's horns onthe sensible Benedick's head?CLAUDIOYea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick themarried man'?BENEDICKFare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leaveyou now to your gossip-like humour: you break jestsas braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thankyou: I must discontinue your company: your brotherthe bastard is fled from Messina: you have amongyou killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my LordLackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, tillthen, peace be with him.ExitDON PEDROHe is in earnest.CLAUDIOIn most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, forthe love of Beatrice.DON PEDROAnd hath challenged thee.CLAUDIOMost sincerely.DON PEDROWhat a pretty thing man is when he goes in hisdoublet and hose and leaves off his wit!CLAUDIOHe is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape adoctor to such a man.DON PEDROBut, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, andbe sad.

Marry, Icannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can findout no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocentrhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominousendings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,nor I cannot woo in festival terms.Enter BEATRICESweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?BEATRICEYea, signior, and depart when you bid me.BENEDICKO, stay but till then!BEATRICE'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ereI go, let me go with that I came; which is, withknowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.BENEDICKOnly foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.BEATRICEFoul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is butfoul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore Iwill depart unkissed.BENEDICKThou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell theeplainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and eitherI must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribehim a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me forwhich of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?BEATRICEFor them all together; which maintained so politica state of evil that they will not admit any goodpart to intermingle with them. But for which of mygood parts did you first suffer love for me?BENEDICKSuffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer loveindeed, for I love thee against my will.BEATRICEIn spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it foryours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.BENEDICKThou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.BEATRICEIt appears not in this confession: there's not onewise man among twenty that will praise himself.BENEDICKAn old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived inthe lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erectin this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall liveno longer in monument than the bell rings and thewidow weeps.BEATRICEAnd how long is that, think you?BENEDICKQuestion: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter inrheum: therefore is it most expedient for thewise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find noimpediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of hisown virtues, as I am to myself. So much forpraising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, ispraiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?BEATRICEVery ill.BENEDICKAnd how do you?BEATRICEVery ill too.BENEDICKServe God, love me and mend.

Which is Beatrice?BEATRICE[Unmasking] I answer to that name.

Dostthou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wearnothing handsome about him. In brief, since I dopurpose to marry, I will think nothing to anypurpose that the world can say against it; andtherefore never flout at me for what I have saidagainst it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is myconclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think tohave beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be mykinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.CLAUDIOI had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy singlelife, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out ofquestion, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not lookexceedingly narrowly to thee.BENEDICKCome, come, we are friends: let's have a dance erewe are married, that we may lighten our own heartsand our wives' heels.LEONATOWe'll have dancing afterward.BENEDICKFirst, of my word; therefore play, music.

Whatshould I say to him? I was then frugal of mymirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a billin the parliament for the putting down of men.

These knightswill hack; and so thou shouldst not alter thearticle of thy gentry.MISTRESS FORDWe burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how Imight be knighted. I shall think the worse of fatmen, as long as I have an eye to make difference ofmen's liking: and yet he would not swear; praisedwomen's modesty; and gave such orderly andwell-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that Iwould have sworn his disposition would have gone tothe truth of his words; but they do no more adhereand keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm tothe tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in hisbelly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revengedon him? I think the best way were to entertain himwith hope, till the wicked fire of lust have meltedhim in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?MISTRESS PAGELetter for letter, but that the name of Page andFord differs! To thy great comfort in this mysteryof ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thyletter: but let thine inherit first; for, Iprotest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath athousand of these letters, writ with blank space fordifferent names--sure, more,--and these are of thesecond edition: he will print them, out of doubt;for he cares not what he puts into the press, whenhe would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find youtwenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.MISTRESS FORDWhy, this is the very same; the very hand, the verywords. What doth he think of us?MISTRESS PAGENay, I know not: it makes me almost ready towrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertainmyself like one that I am not acquainted withal;for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that Iknow not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.MISTRESS FORD'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep himabove deck.MISTRESS PAGESo will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll neverto sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let'sappoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort inhis suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.MISTRESS FORDNay, I will consent to act any villany against him,that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,that my husband saw this letter! it would giveeternal food to his jealousy.MISTRESS PAGEWhy, look where he comes; and my good man too: he'sas far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.MISTRESS FORDYou are the happier woman.MISTRESS PAGELet's consult together against this greasy knight.Come hither.They retireEnter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYMFORDWell, I hope it be not so.PISTOLHope is a curtal dog in some affairs:Sir John affects thy wife.FORDWhy, sir, my wife is not young.PISTOLHe wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,Both young and old, one with another, Ford;He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.FORDLove my wife!PISTOLWith liver burning hot.

Does he lie atthe Garter?PAGEAy, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyagetowards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; andwhat he gets more of her than sharp words, let itlie on my head.FORDI do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath toturn them together.

Why, thou unconfinablebaseness, it is as much as I can do to keep theterms of my honour precise: I, I, I myselfsometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left handand hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain toshuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountainlooks, your red-lattice phrases, and yourbold-beating oaths, under the shelter of yourhonour!

The best courtier of them all, when thecourt lay at Windsor, could never have brought herto such a canary. Yet there has been knights, andlords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrantyou, coach after coach, letter after letter, giftafter gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and sorushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and insuch alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar ofthe best and the fairest, that would have won anywoman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could neverget an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angelsgiven me this morning; but I defy all angels, inany such sort, as they say, but in the way ofhonesty: and, I warrant you, they could never gether so much as sip on a cup with the proudest ofthem all: and yet there has been earls, nay, whichis more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.FALSTAFFBut what says she to me? be brief, my goodshe-Mercury.MISTRESS QUICKLYMarry, she hath received your letter, for the whichshe thanks you a thousand times; and she gives youto notify that her husband will be absence from hishouse between ten and eleven.FALSTAFFTen and eleven?MISTRESS QUICKLYAy, forsooth; and then you may come and see thepicture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,her husband, will be from home.

Woman, commend me to her; I willnot fail her.MISTRESS QUICKLYWhy, you say well. But I have another messenger toyour worship.

Never a wife inWindsor leads a better life than she does: do whatshe will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goto bed when she list, rise when she list, all is asshe will: and truly she deserves it; for if therebe a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You mustsend her your page; no remedy.FALSTAFFWhy, I will.MISTRESS QUICKLYNay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come andgo between you both; and in any case have anay-word, that you may know one another's mind, andthe boy never need to understand any thing; for'tis not good that children should know anywickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,as they say, and know the world.FALSTAFFFare thee well: commend me to them both: there'smy purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along withthis woman.Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBINThis news distracts me!PISTOLThis punk is one of Cupid's carriers:Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!ExitFALSTAFFSayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll makemore of thy old body than I have done. Will theyyet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expenseof so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, Ithank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it befairly done, no matter.Enter BARDOLPHBARDOLPHSir John, there's one Master Brook below would fainspeak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hathsent your worship a morning's draught of sack.FALSTAFFBrook is his name?BARDOLPHAy, sir.FALSTAFFCall him in.Exit BARDOLPHSuch Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow suchliquor.

Give us leave, drawer.Exit BARDOLPHFORDSir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.FALSTAFFGood Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.FORDGood Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;for I must let you understand I think myself inbetter plight for a lender than you are: the whichhath something embolden'd me to this unseasonedintrusion; for they say, if money go before, allways do lie open.FALSTAFFMoney is a good soldier, sir, and will on.FORDTroth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, orhalf, for easing me of the carriage.FALSTAFFSir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.FORDI will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.FALSTAFFSpeak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to beyour servant.FORDSir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be briefwith you,--and you have been a man long known to me,though I had never so good means, as desire, to makemyself acquainted with you. I shall discover athing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mineown imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you haveone eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,turn another into the register of your own; that Imay pass with a reproof the easier, sith youyourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.FALSTAFFVery well, sir; proceed.FORDThere is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband'sname is Ford.FALSTAFFWell, sir.FORDI have long loved her, and, I protest to you,bestowed much on her; followed her with a dotingobservance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardlygive me sight of her; not only bought many presentsto give her, but have given largely to many to knowwhat she would have given; briefly, I have pursuedher as love hath pursued me; which hath been on thewing of all occasions. But whatsoever I havemerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,I am sure, I have received none; unless experiencebe a jewel that I have purchased at an infiniterate, and that hath taught me to say this:'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'FALSTAFFHave you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?FORDNever.FALSTAFFHave you importuned her to such a purpose?FORDNever.FALSTAFFOf what quality was your love, then?FORDLike a fair house built on another man's ground; sothat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the placewhere I erected it.FALSTAFFTo what purpose have you unfolded this to me?FORDWhen I have told you that, I have told you all.Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet inother places she enlargeth her mirth so far thatthere is shrewd construction made of her. Now, SirJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are agentleman of excellent breeding, admirablediscourse, of great admittance, authentic in yourplace and person, generally allowed for your manywar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.FALSTAFFO, sir!FORDBelieve it, for you know it. There is money; spendit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; onlygive me so much of your time in exchange of it, asto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of thisFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her toconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon asany.FALSTAFFWould it apply well to the vehemency of youraffection, that I should win what you would enjoy?Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.FORDO, understand my drift. She dwells so securely onthe excellency of her honour, that the folly of mysoul dares not present itself: she is too bright tobe looked against. Now, could I could come to herwith any detection in my hand, my desires hadinstance and argument to commend themselves: Icould drive her then from the ward of her purity,her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousandother her defences, which now are too too stronglyembattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?FALSTAFFMaster Brook, I will first make bold with yourmoney; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am agentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.FORDO good sir!FALSTAFFI say you shall.FORDWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.FALSTAFFWant no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall wantnone. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by herown appointment; even as you came in to me, herassistant or go-between parted from me: I say Ishall be with her between ten and eleven; for atthat time the jealous rascally knave her husbandwill be forth. Come you to me at night; you shallknow how I speed.FORDI am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,sir?FALSTAFFHang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say thejealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for thewhich his wife seems to me well-favored. I willuse her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;and there's my harvest-home.FORDI would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid himif you saw him.FALSTAFFHang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I willstare him out of his wits; I will awe him with mycudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er thecuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know Iwill predominate over the peasant, and thou shaltlie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave andcuckold. Come to me soon at night.ExitFORDWhat a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart isready to crack with impatience. Who says this isimprovident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; thehour is fixed; the match is made. Would any manhave thought this? See the hell of having a falsewoman! My bed shall be abused, my coffersransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall notonly receive this villanous wrong, but stand underthe adoption of abominable terms, and by him thatdoes me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon soundswell; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they aredevils' additions, the names of fiends: butCuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hathnot such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: hewill trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I willrather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hughthe Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with myaqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my amblinggelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,then she ruminates, then she devises; and what theythink in their hearts they may effect, they willbreak their hearts but they will effect. God bepraised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged onFalstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;better three hours too soon than a minute too late.Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!ExitSCENE III.

Well, if I be served such another trick,I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and givethem to a dog for a new-year's gift. The roguesslighted me into the river with as little remorse asthey would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my sizethat I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if thebottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I hadbeen drowned, but that the shore was shelvy andshallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swellsa man; and what a thing should I have been when Ihad been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.Re-enter BARDOLPH with sackBARDOLPHHere's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.FALSTAFFLet me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for mybelly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs forpills to cool the reins.

Her husband goes this morninga-birding; she desires you once more to come to herbetween eight and nine: I must carry her wordquickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.FALSTAFFWell, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid herthink what a man is: let her consider his frailty,and then judge of my merit.MISTRESS QUICKLYI will tell her.FALSTAFFDo so.

O, here he comes.Enter FORDFORDBless you, sir!FALSTAFFNow, master Brook, you come to know what hath passedbetween me and Ford's wife?FORDThat, indeed, Sir John, is my business.FALSTAFFMaster Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at herhouse the hour she appointed me.FORDAnd sped you, sir?FALSTAFFVery ill-favoredly, Master Brook.FORDHow so, sir? Did she change her determination?FALSTAFFNo, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto herhusband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of ourencounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thitherprovoked and instigated by his distemper, and,forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.FORDWhat, while you were there?FALSTAFFWhile I was there.FORDAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?FALSTAFFYou shall hear. As good luck would have it, comesin one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford'sapproach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife'sdistraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.FORDA buck-basket!FALSTAFFBy the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foulshirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasynapkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankestcompound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.FORDAnd how long lay you there?FALSTAFFNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I havesuffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford'sknaves, his hinds, were called forth by theirmistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes toDatchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; metthe jealous knave their master in the door, whoasked them once or twice what they had in theirbasket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knavewould have searched it; but fate, ordaining heshould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went hefor a search, and away went I for foul clothes. Butmark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangsof three several deaths; first, an intolerablefright, to be detected with a jealous rottenbell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a goodbilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt topoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,like a strong distillation, with stinking clothesthat fretted in their own grease: think of that,--aman of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subjectto heat as butter; a man of continual dissolutionand thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.And in the height of this bath, when I was more thanhalf stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to bethrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think ofthat,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.FORDIn good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake youhave sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;you'll undertake her no more?FALSTAFFMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I havebeen into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Herhusband is this morning gone a-birding: I havereceived from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixteight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.FORD'Tis past eight already, sir.FALSTAFFIs it? I will then address me to my appointment.Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shallknow how I speed; and the conclusion shall becrowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shallhave her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shallcuckold Ford.ExitFORDHum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do Isleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linenand buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myselfwhat I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at myhouse; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible heshould; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil thatguides him should aid him, I will searchimpossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb gowith me: I'll be horn-mad.ExitACT IVSCENE I.

Now, thus it rests:Her father means she shall be all in white,And in that habit, when Slender sees his timeTo take her by the hand and bid her go,She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,The better to denote her to the doctor,For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,The maid hath given consent to go with him.HostWhich means she to deceive, father or mother?FENTONBoth, my good host, to go along with me:And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicarTo stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,And, in the lawful name of marrying,To give our hearts united ceremony.HostWell, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.FENTONSo shall I evermore be bound to thee;Besides, I'll make a present recompense.ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

I was three or fourtimes in the thought they were not fairies: and yetthe guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of mypowers, drove the grossness of the foppery into areceived belief, in despite of the teeth of allrhyme and reason, that they were fairies.

My noble lord,This man hath my consent to marry her.Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,And interchanged love-tokens with my child:Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,With feigning voice verses of feigning love,And stolen the impression of her fantasyWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengersOf strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,Be it so she; will not here before your graceConsent to marry with Demetrius,I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,As she is mine, I may dispose of her:Which shall be either to this gentlemanOr to her death, according to our lawImmediately provided in that case.THESEUSWhat say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:To you your father should be as a god;One that composed your beauties, yea, and oneTo whom you are but as a form in waxBy him imprinted and within his powerTo leave the figure or disfigure it.Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.HERMIASo is Lysander.THESEUSIn himself he is;But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,The other must be held the worthier.HERMIAI would my father look'd but with my eyes.THESEUSRather your eyes must with his judgment look.HERMIAI do entreat your grace to pardon me.I know not by what power I am made bold,Nor how it may concern my modesty,In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;But I beseech your grace that I may knowThe worst that may befall me in this case,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.THESEUSEither to die the death or to abjureFor ever the society of men.Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;Know of your youth, examine well your blood,Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,You can endure the livery of a nun,For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,To live a barren sister all your life,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,Than that which withering on the virgin thornGrows, lives and dies in single blessedness.HERMIASo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,Ere I will my virgin patent upUnto his lordship, whose unwished yokeMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.THESEUSTake time to pause; and, by the next new moon--The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,For everlasting bond of fellowship--Upon that day either prepare to dieFor disobedience to your father's will,Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;Or on Diana's altar to protestFor aye austerity and single life.DEMETRIUSRelent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yieldThy crazed title to my certain right.LYSANDERYou have her father's love, Demetrius;Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.EGEUSScornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,And what is mine my love shall render him.And she is mine, and all my right of herI do estate unto Demetrius.LYSANDERI am, my lord, as well derived as he,As well possess'd; my love is more than his;My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,If not with vantage, as Demetrius';And, which is more than all these boasts can be,I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:Why should not I then prosecute my right?Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.THESEUSI must confess that I have heard so much,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;But, being over-full of self-affairs,My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,I have some private schooling for you both.For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourselfTo fit your fancies to your father's will;Or else the law of Athens yields you up--Which by no means we may extenuate--To death, or to a vow of single life.Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?Demetrius and Egeus, go along:I must employ you in some businessAgainst our nuptial and confer with youOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.EGEUSWith duty and desire we follow you.Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIALYSANDERHow now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?How chance the roses there do fade so fast?HERMIABelike for want of rain, which I could wellBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.LYSANDERAy me! for aught that I could ever read,Could ever hear by tale or history,The course of true love never did run smooth;But, either it was different in blood,--HERMIAO cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.LYSANDEROr else misgraffed in respect of years,--HERMIAO spite! too old to be engaged to young.LYSANDEROr else it stood upon the choice of friends,--HERMIAO hell! to choose love by another's eyes.LYSANDEROr, if there were a sympathy in choice,War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,Making it momentany as a sound,Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;Brief as the lightning in the collied night,That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'The jaws of darkness do devour it up:So quick bright things come to confusion.HERMIAIf then true lovers have been ever cross'd,It stands as an edict in destiny:Then let us teach our trial patience,Because it is a customary cross,As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.LYSANDERA good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.I have a widow aunt, a dowagerOf great revenue, and she hath no child:From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;And she respects me as her only son.There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;And to that place the sharp Athenian lawCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;And in the wood, a league without the town,Where I did meet thee once with Helena,To do observance to a morn of May,There will I stay for thee.HERMIAMy good Lysander!I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,By his best arrow with the golden head,By the simplicity of Venus' doves,By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,When the false Troyan under sail was seen,By all the vows that ever men have broke,In number more than ever women spoke,In that same place thou hast appointed me,To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.LYSANDERKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.Enter HELENAHERMIAGod speed fair Helena! whither away?HELENACall you me fair? that fair again unsay.Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet airMore tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,The rest I'd give to be to you translated.O, teach me how you look, and with what artYou sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.HERMIAI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.HELENAO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!HERMIAI give him curses, yet he gives me love.HELENAO that my prayers could such affection move!HERMIAThe more I hate, the more he follows me.HELENAThe more I love, the more he hateth me.HERMIAHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.HELENANone, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!HERMIATake comfort: he no more shall see my face;Lysander and myself will fly this place.Before the time I did Lysander see,Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!LYSANDERHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth beholdHer silver visage in the watery glass,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.HERMIAAnd in the wood, where often you and IUpon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,There my Lysander and myself shall meet;And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,To seek new friends and stranger companies.Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sightFrom lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.LYSANDERI will, my Hermia.Exit HERMIAHelena, adieu:As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!ExitHELENAHow happy some o'er other some can be!Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;He will not know what all but he do know:And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,So I, admiring of his qualities:Things base and vile, folding no quantity,Love can transpose to form and dignity:Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:And therefore is Love said to be a child,Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,So the boy Love is perjured every where:For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:Then to the wood will he to-morrow nightPursue her; and for this intelligenceIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense:But herein mean I to enrich my pain,To have his sight thither and back again.ExitSCENE II.

QUINCE'S house.Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELINGQUINCEIs all our company here?BOTTOMYou were best to call them generally, man by man,according to the scrip.QUINCEHere is the scroll of every man's name, which isthought fit, through all Athens, to play in ourinterlude before the duke and the duchess, on hiswedding-day at night.BOTTOMFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treatson, then read the names of the actors, and so growto a point.QUINCEMarry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, andmost cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.BOTTOMA very good piece of work, I assure you, and amerry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth youractors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.QUINCEAnswer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.BOTTOMReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.QUINCEYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.BOTTOMWhat is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?QUINCEA lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.BOTTOMThat will ask some tears in the true performing ofit: if I do it, let the audience look to theireyes; I will move storms, I will condole in somemeasure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for atyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part totear a cat in, to make all split.The raging rocksAnd shivering shocksShall break the locksOf prison gates;And Phibbus' carShall shine from farAnd make and marThe foolish Fates.This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover ismore condoling.QUINCEFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.FLUTEHere, Peter Quince.QUINCEFlute, you must take Thisby on you.FLUTEWhat is Thisby? a wandering knight?QUINCEIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.FLUTENay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.QUINCEThat's all one: you shall play it in a mask, andyou may speak as small as you will.BOTTOMAn I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'llspeak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,and lady dear!'QUINCENo, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.BOTTOMWell, proceed.QUINCERobin Starveling, the tailor.STARVELINGHere, Peter Quince.QUINCERobin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.Tom Snout, the tinker.SNOUTHere, Peter Quince.QUINCEYou, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, Ihope, here is a play fitted.SNUGHave you the lion's part written? pray you, if itbe, give it me, for I am slow of study.QUINCEYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.BOTTOMLet me play the lion too: I will roar, that I willdo any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,let him roar again.'QUINCEAn you should do it too terribly, you would frightthe duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;and that were enough to hang us all.ALLThat would hang us, every mother's son.BOTTOMI grant you, friends, if that you should fright theladies out of their wits, they would have no morediscretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate myvoice so that I will roar you as gently as anysucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere anynightingale.QUINCEYou can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is asweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in asummer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:therefore you must needs play Pyramus.BOTTOMWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I bestto play it in?QUINCEWhy, what you will.BOTTOMI will discharge it in either your straw-colourbeard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grainbeard, or your French-crown-colour beard, yourperfect yellow.QUINCESome of your French crowns have no hair at all, andthen you will play bare-faced. But, masters, hereare your parts: and I am to entreat you, requestyou and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without thetown, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for ifwe meet in the city, we shall be dogged withcompany, and our devices known. In the meantime Iwill draw a bill of properties, such as our playwants. I pray you, fail me not.BOTTOMWe will meet; and there we may rehearse mostobscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.QUINCEAt the duke's oak we meet.BOTTOMEnough; hold or cut bow-strings.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. A wood near Athens.Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCKPUCKHow now, spirit! whither wander you?FairyOver hill, over dale,Thorough bush, thorough brier,Over park, over pale,Thorough flood, thorough fire,I do wander everywhere,Swifter than the moon's sphere;And I serve the fairy queen,To dew her orbs upon the green.The cowslips tall her pensioners be:In their gold coats spots you see;Those be rubies, fairy favours,In those freckles live their savours:I must go seek some dewdrops hereAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:Our queen and all our elves come here anon.PUCKThe king doth keep his revels here to-night:Take heed the queen come not within his sight;For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,Because that she as her attendant hathA lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;She never had so sweet a changeling;And jealous Oberon would have the childKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild;But she perforce withholds the loved boy,Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:And now they never meet in grove or green,By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,But, they do square, that all their elves for fearCreep into acorn-cups and hide them there.FairyEither I mistake your shape and making quite,Or else you are that shrewd and knavish spriteCall'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you heThat frights the maidens of the villagery;Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quernAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn;And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,You do their work, and they shall have good luck:Are not you he?PUCKThou speak'st aright;I am that merry wanderer of the night.I jest to Oberon and make him smileWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,In very likeness of a roasted crab,And when she drinks, against her lips I bobAnd on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swearA merrier hour was never wasted there.But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.FairyAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hersOBERONIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.TITANIAWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:I have forsworn his bed and company.OBERONTarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?TITANIAThen I must be thy lady: but I knowWhen thou hast stolen away from fairy land,And in the shape of Corin sat all day,Playing on pipes of corn and versing loveTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,Come from the farthest Steppe of India?But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,To Theseus must be wedded, and you comeTo give their bed joy and prosperity.OBERONHow canst thou thus for shame, Titania,Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering nightFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,With Ariadne and Antiopa?TITANIAThese are the forgeries of jealousy:And never, since the middle summer's spring,Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,By paved fountain or by rushy brook,Or in the beached margent of the sea,To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,As in revenge, have suck'd up from the seaContagious fogs; which falling in the landHave every pelting river made so proudThat they have overborne their continents:The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green cornHath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;The fold stands empty in the drowned field,And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,And the quaint mazes in the wanton greenFor lack of tread are undistinguishable:The human mortals want their winter here;No night is now with hymn or carol blest:Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,Pale in her anger, washes all the air,That rheumatic diseases do abound:And thorough this distemperature we seeThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frostsFar in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,And on old Hiems' thin and icy crownAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer budsIs, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,The childing autumn, angry winter, changeTheir wonted liveries, and the mazed world,By their increase, now knows not which is which:And this same progeny of evils comesFrom our debate, from our dissension;We are their parents and original.OBERONDo you amend it then; it lies in you:Why should Titania cross her Oberon?I do but beg a little changeling boy,To be my henchman.TITANIASet your heart at rest:The fairy land buys not the child of me.His mother was a votaress of my order:And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,Marking the embarked traders on the flood,When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceiveAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;Which she, with pretty and with swimming gaitFollowing,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--Would imitate, and sail upon the land,To fetch me trifles, and return again,As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;And for her sake do I rear up her boy,And for her sake I will not part with him.OBERONHow long within this wood intend you stay?TITANIAPerchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.If you will patiently dance in our roundAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.OBERONGive me that boy, and I will go with thee.TITANIANot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.Exit TITANIA with her trainOBERONWell, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groveTill I torment thee for this injury.My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberestSince once I sat upon a promontory,And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's backUttering such dulcet and harmonious breathThat the rude sea grew civil at her songAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres,To hear the sea-maid's music.PUCKI remember.OBERONThat very time I saw, but thou couldst not,Flying between the cold moon and the earth,Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he tookAt a fair vestal throned by the west,And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaftQuench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,And the imperial votaress passed on,In maiden meditation, fancy-free.Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:It fell upon a little western flower,Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,And maidens call it love-in-idleness.Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laidWill make or man or woman madly doteUpon the next live creature that it sees.Fetch me this herb; and be thou here againEre the leviathan can swim a league.PUCKI'll put a girdle round about the earthIn forty minutes.ExitOBERONHaving once this juice,I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.The next thing then she waking looks upon,Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,She shall pursue it with the soul of love:And ere I take this charm from off her sight,As I can take it with another herb,I'll make her render up her page to me.But who comes here? I am invisible;And I will overhear their conference.Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following himDEMETRIUSI love thee not, therefore pursue me not.Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;And here am I, and wode within this wood,Because I cannot meet my Hermia.Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.HELENAYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;But yet you draw not iron, for my heartIs true as steel: leave you your power to draw,And I shall have no power to follow you.DEMETRIUSDo I entice you? do I speak you fair?Or, rather, do I not in plainest truthTell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?HELENAAnd even for that do I love you the more.I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,Unworthy as I am, to follow you.What worser place can I beg in your love,--And yet a place of high respect with me,--Than to be used as you use your dog?DEMETRIUSTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;For I am sick when I do look on thee.HELENAAnd I am sick when I look not on you.DEMETRIUSYou do impeach your modesty too much,To leave the city and commit yourselfInto the hands of one that loves you not;To trust the opportunity of nightAnd the ill counsel of a desert placeWith the rich worth of your virginity.HELENAYour virtue is my privilege: for thatIt is not night when I do see your face,Therefore I think I am not in the night;Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,For you in my respect are all the world:Then how can it be said I am alone,When all the world is here to look on me?DEMETRIUSI'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.HELENAThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.Run when you will, the story shall be changed:Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hindMakes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,When cowardice pursues and valour flies.DEMETRIUSI will not stay thy questions; let me go:Or, if thou follow me, do not believeBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.HELENAAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:We cannot fight for love, as men may do;We should be wood and were not made to woo.Exit DEMETRIUSI'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,To die upon the hand I love so well.ExitOBERONFare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.Re-enter PUCKHast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.PUCKAy, there it is.OBERONI pray thee, give it me.I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,And make her full of hateful fantasies.Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:A sweet Athenian lady is in loveWith a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;But do it when the next thing he espiesMay be the lady: thou shalt know the manBy the Athenian garments he hath on.Effect it with some care, that he may proveMore fond on her than she upon her love:And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.PUCKFear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.ExeuntSCENE II.

Not with salt tears:If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;For beasts that meet me run away for fear:Therefore no marvel though DemetriusDo, as a monster fly my presence thus.What wicked and dissembling glass of mineMade me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?But who is here?

Hermia, sleep thou there:And never mayst thou come Lysander near!For as a surfeit of the sweetest thingsThe deepest loathing to the stomach brings,Or as tie heresies that men do leaveAre hated most of those they did deceive,So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,Of all be hated, but the most of me!And, all my powers, address your love and mightTo honour Helen and to be her knight!ExitHERMIA[Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy bestTo pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:Methought a serpent eat my heart away,And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;Speak, of all loves!

TITANIA lying asleep.Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELINGBOTTOMAre we all met?QUINCEPat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient placefor our rehearsal. This green plot shall be ourstage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and wewill do it in action as we will do it before the duke.BOTTOMPeter Quince,--QUINCEWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?BOTTOMThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus andThisby that will never please. First, Pyramus mustdraw a sword to kill himself; which the ladiescannot abide. How answer you that?SNOUTBy'r lakin, a parlous fear.STARVELINGI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.BOTTOMNot a whit: I have a device to make all well.Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem tosay, we will do no harm with our swords, and thatPyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the morebetter assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am notPyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put themout of fear.QUINCEWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall bewritten in eight and six.BOTTOMNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.SNOUTWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?STARVELINGI fear it, I promise you.BOTTOMMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves: tobring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is amost dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearfulwild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought tolook to 't.SNOUTTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.BOTTOMNay, you must name his name, and half his face mustbe seen through the lion's neck: and he himselfmust speak through, saying thus, or to the samedefect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wishYou,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I wouldentreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my lifefor yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, itwere pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am aman as other men are;' and there indeed let him namehis name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.QUINCEWell it shall be so. But there is two hard things;that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.SNOUTDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?BOTTOMA calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; findout moonshine, find out moonshine.QUINCEYes, it doth shine that night.BOTTOMWhy, then may you leave a casement of the greatchamber window, where we play, open, and the moonmay shine in at the casement.QUINCEAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thornsand a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or topresent, the person of Moonshine.

Another part of the wood.Enter OBERONOBERONI wonder if Titania be awaked;Then, what it was that next came in her eye,Which she must dote on in extremity.Enter PUCKHere comes my messenger.How now, mad spirit!What night-rule now about this haunted grove?PUCKMy mistress with a monster is in love.Near to her close and consecrated bower,While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,Were met together to rehearse a playIntended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,Who Pyramus presented, in their sportForsook his scene and enter'd in a brakeWhen I did him at this advantage take,An ass's nole I fixed on his head:Anon his Thisbe must be answered,And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,Rising and cawing at the gun's report,Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;He murder cries and help from Athens calls.Their sense thus weak, lost with their fearsthus strong,Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders allthings catch.I led them on in this distracted fear,And left sweet Pyramus translated there:When in that moment, so it came to pass,Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.OBERONThis falls out better than I could devise.But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyesWith the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?PUCKI took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--And the Athenian woman by his side:That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUSOBERONStand close: this is the same Athenian.PUCKThis is the woman, but not this the man.DEMETRIUSO, why rebuke you him that loves you so?Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.HERMIANow I but chide; but I should use thee worse,For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,And kill me too.The sun was not so true unto the dayAs he to me: would he have stolen awayFrom sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soonThis whole earth may be bored and that the moonMay through the centre creep and so displeaseHer brother's noontide with Antipodes.It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.DEMETRIUSSo should the murder'd look, and so should I,Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.HERMIAWhat's this to my Lysander? where is he?Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?DEMETRIUSI had rather give his carcass to my hounds.HERMIAOut, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the boundsOf maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?Henceforth be never number'd among men!O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?An adder did it; for with doubler tongueThan thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.DEMETRIUSYou spend your passion on a misprised mood:I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.HERMIAI pray thee, tell me then that he is well.DEMETRIUSAn if I could, what should I get therefore?HERMIAA privilege never to see me more.And from thy hated presence part I so:See me no more, whether he be dead or no.ExitDEMETRIUSThere is no following her in this fierce vein:Here therefore for a while I will remain.So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier growFor debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:Which now in some slight measure it will pay,If for his tender here I make some stay.Lies down and sleepsOBERONWhat hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quiteAnd laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:Of thy misprision must perforce ensueSome true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.PUCKThen fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,A million fail, confounding oath on oath.OBERONAbout the wood go swifter than the wind,And Helena of Athens look thou find:All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:By some illusion see thou bring her here:I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.PUCKI go, I go; look how I go,Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.ExitOBERONFlower of this purple dye,Hit with Cupid's archery,Sink in apple of his eye.When his love he doth espy,Let her shine as gloriouslyAs the Venus of the sky.When thou wakest, if she be by,Beg of her for remedy.Re-enter PUCKPUCKCaptain of our fairy band,Helena is here at hand;And the youth, mistook by me,Pleading for a lover's fee.Shall we their fond pageant see?Lord, what fools these mortals be!OBERONStand aside: the noise they makeWill cause Demetrius to awake.PUCKThen will two at once woo one;That must needs be sport alone;And those things do best please meThat befal preposterously.Enter LYSANDER and HELENALYSANDERWhy should you think that I should woo in scorn?Scorn and derision never come in tears:Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,In their nativity all truth appears.How can these things in me seem scorn to you,Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?HELENAYou do advance your cunning more and more.When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.LYSANDERI had no judgment when to her I swore.HELENANor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.LYSANDERDemetrius loves her, and he loves not you.DEMETRIUS[Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in showThy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crowWhen thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kissThis princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!HELENAO spite! O hell! I see you all are bentTo set against me for your merriment:If you we re civil and knew courtesy,You would not do me thus much injury.Can you not hate me, as I know you do,But you must join in souls to mock me too?If you were men, as men you are in show,You would not use a gentle lady so;To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.You both are rivals, and love Hermia;And now both rivals, to mock Helena:A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyesWith your derision! none of noble sortWould so offend a virgin, and extortA poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.LYSANDERYou are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;For you love Hermia; this you know I know:And here, with all good will, with all my heart,In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;And yours of Helena to me bequeath,Whom I do love and will do till my death.HELENANever did mockers waste more idle breath.DEMETRIUSLysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,And now to Helen is it home return'd,There to remain.LYSANDERHelen, it is not so.DEMETRIUSDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.Re-enter HERMIAHERMIADark night, that from the eye his function takes,The ear more quick of apprehension makes;Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,It pays the hearing double recompense.Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy soundBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?LYSANDERWhy should he stay, whom love doth press to go?HERMIAWhat love could press Lysander from my side?LYSANDERLysander's love, that would not let him bide,Fair Helena, who more engilds the nightThan all you fiery oes and eyes of light.Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?HERMIAYou speak not as you think: it cannot be.HELENALo, she is one of this confederacy!Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all threeTo fashion this false sport, in spite of me.Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!Have you conspired, have you with these contrivedTo bait me with this foul derision?Is all the counsel that we two have shared,The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,When we have chid the hasty-footed timeFor parting us,--O, is it all forgot?All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,Have with our needles created both one flower,Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,Both warbling of one song, both in one key,As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,Had been incorporate. So we grow together,Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,But yet an union in partition;Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,Due but to one and crowned with one crest.And will you rent our ancient love asunder,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,Though I alone do feel the injury.HERMIAI am amazed at your passionate words.I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.HELENAHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,To follow me and praise my eyes and face?And made your other love, Demetrius,Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he thisTo her he hates? and wherefore doth LysanderDeny your love, so rich within his soul,And tender me, forsooth, affection,But by your setting on, by your consent?What thought I be not so in grace as you,So hung upon with love, so fortunate,But miserable most, to love unloved?This you should pity rather than despise.HERNIAI understand not what you mean by this.HELENAAy, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.If you have any pity, grace, or manners,You would not make me such an argument.But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;Which death or absence soon shall remedy.LYSANDERStay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!HELENAO excellent!HERMIASweet, do not scorn her so.DEMETRIUSIf she cannot entreat, I can compel.LYSANDERThou canst compel no more than she entreat:Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:I swear by that which I will lose for thee,To prove him false that says I love thee not.DEMETRIUSI say I love thee more than he can do.LYSANDERIf thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.DEMETRIUSQuick, come!HERMIALysander, whereto tends all this?LYSANDERAway, you Ethiope!DEMETRIUSNo, no; he'll [ ]Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!LYSANDERHang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!HERMIAWhy are you grown so rude? what change is this?Sweet love,--LYSANDERThy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!HERMIADo you not jest?HELENAYes, sooth; and so do you.LYSANDERDemetrius, I will keep my word with thee.DEMETRIUSI would I had your bond, for I perceiveA weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.LYSANDERWhat, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.HERMIAWhat, can you do me greater harm than hate?Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?I am as fair now as I was erewhile.Since night you loved me; yet since night you leftme:Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--In earnest, shall I say?LYSANDERAy, by my life;And never did desire to see thee more.Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jestThat I do hate thee and love Helena.HERMIAO me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!You thief of love! what, have you come by nightAnd stolen my love's heart from him?HELENAFine, i'faith!Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tearImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!HERMIAPuppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.Now I perceive that she hath made compareBetween our statures; she hath urged her height;And with her personage, her tall personage,Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.And are you grown so high in his esteem;Because I am so dwarfish and so low?How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;How low am I? I am not yet so lowBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.HELENAI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;I have no gift at all in shrewishness;I am a right maid for my cowardice:Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,Because she is something lower than myself,That I can match her.HERMIALower! hark, again.HELENAGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.I evermore did love you, Hermia,Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;Save that, in love unto Demetrius,I told him of your stealth unto this wood.He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd meTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:And now, so you will let me quiet go,To Athens will I bear my folly backAnd follow you no further: let me go:You see how simple and how fond I am.HERMIAWhy, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?HELENAA foolish heart, that I leave here behind.HERMIAWhat, with Lysander?HELENAWith Demetrius.LYSANDERBe not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.DEMETRIUSNo, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.HELENAO, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!She was a vixen when she went to school;And though she be but little, she is fierce.HERMIA'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?Let me come to her.LYSANDERGet you gone, you dwarf;You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;You bead, you acorn.DEMETRIUSYou are too officiousIn her behalf that scorns your services.Let her alone: speak not of Helena;Take not her part; for, if thou dost intendNever so little show of love to her,Thou shalt aby it.LYSANDERNow she holds me not;Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.DEMETRIUSFollow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUSHERMIAYou, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:Nay, go not back.HELENAI will not trust you, I,Nor longer stay in your curst company.Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,My legs are longer though, to run away.ExitHERMIAI am amazed, and know not what to say.ExitOBERONThis is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.PUCKBelieve me, king of shadows, I mistook.Did not you tell me I should know the manBy the Athenian garment be had on?And so far blameless proves my enterprise,That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;And so far am I glad it so did sortAs this their jangling I esteem a sport.OBERONThou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;The starry welkin cover thou anonWith drooping fog as black as Acheron,And lead these testy rivals so astrayAs one come not within another's way.Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;And from each other look thou lead them thus,Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleepWith leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,To take from thence all error with his might,And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.When they next wake, all this derisionShall seem a dream and fruitless vision,And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,With league whose date till death shall never end.Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;And then I will her charmed eye releaseFrom monster's view, and all things shall be peace.PUCKMy fairy lord, this must be done with haste,For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,That in crossways and floods have burial,Already to their wormy beds are gone;For fear lest day should look their shames upon,They willfully themselves exile from lightAnd must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.OBERONBut we are spirits of another sort:I with the morning's love have oft made sport,And, like a forester, the groves may tread,Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:We may effect this business yet ere day.ExitPUCKUp and down, up and down,I will lead them up and down:I am fear'd in field and town:Goblin, lead them up and down.Here comes one.Re-enter LYSANDERLYSANDERWhere art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.PUCKHere, villain; drawn and ready.

Come, my queen, take hands with me,And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.Now thou and I are new in amity,And will to-morrow midnight solemnlyDance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,And bless it to all fair prosperity:There shall the pairs of faithful lovers beWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.PUCKFairy king, attend, and mark:I do hear the morning lark.OBERONThen, my queen, in silence sad,Trip we after the night's shade:We the globe can compass soon,Swifter than the wandering moon.TITANIACome, my lord, and in our flightTell me how it came this nightThat I sleeping here was foundWith these mortals on the ground.ExeuntHorns winded withinEnter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and trainTHESEUSGo, one of you, find out the forester;For now our observation is perform'd;And since we have the vaward of the day,My love shall hear the music of my hounds.Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.Exit an AttendantWe will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,And mark the musical confusionOf hounds and echo in conjunction.HIPPOLYTAI was with Hercules and Cadmus once,When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bearWith hounds of Sparta: never did I hearSuch gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,The skies, the fountains, every region nearSeem'd all one mutual cry: I never heardSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.THESEUSMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hungWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,Each under each. A cry more tuneableWas never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?EGEUSMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep;And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:I wonder of their being here together.THESEUSNo doubt they rose up early to observeThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,Came here in grace our solemnity.But speak, Egeus; is not this the dayThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?EGEUSIt is, my lord.THESEUSGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start upGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?LYSANDERPardon, my lord.THESEUSI pray you all, stand up.I know you two are rival enemies:How comes this gentle concord in the world,That hatred is so far from jealousy,To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?LYSANDERMy lord, I shall reply amazedly,Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,I cannot truly say how I came here;But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,And now do I bethink me, so it is,--I came with Hermia hither: our intentWas to be gone from Athens, where we might,Without the peril of the Athenian law.EGEUSEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough:I beg the law, the law, upon his head.They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,Thereby to have defeated you and me,You of your wife and me of my consent,Of my consent that she should be your wife.DEMETRIUSMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,Of this their purpose hither to this wood;And I in fury hither follow'd them,Fair Helena in fancy following me.But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,Melted as the snow, seems to me nowAs the remembrance of an idle gaudWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,The object and the pleasure of mine eye,Is only Helena. To her, my lord,Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;But, as in health, come to my natural taste,Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,And will for evermore be true to it.THESEUSFair lovers, you are fortunately met:Of this discourse we more will hear anon.Egeus, I will overbear your will;For in the temple by and by with usThese couples shall eternally be knit:And, for the morning now is something worn,Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.Away with us to Athens; three and three,We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.Come, Hippolyta.Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and trainDEMETRIUSThese things seem small and undistinguishable,HERMIAMethinks I see these things with parted eye,When every thing seems double.HELENASo methinks:And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,Mine own, and not mine own.DEMETRIUSAre you sureThat we are awake? It seems to meThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you thinkThe duke was here, and bid us follow him?HERMIAYea; and my father.HELENAAnd Hippolyta.LYSANDERAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.DEMETRIUSWhy, then, we are awake: let's follow himAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.ExeuntBOTTOM[Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I willanswer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolenhence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rarevision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man tosay what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he goabout to expound this dream. Methought I was--thereis no man can tell what. Methought I was,--andmethought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, ifhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eyeof man hath not heard, the ear of man hath notseen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongueto conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dreamwas. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad ofthis dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in thelatter end of a play, before the duke:peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shallsing it at her death.ExitSCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELINGQUINCEHave you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?STARVELINGHe cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he istransported.FLUTEIf he come not, then the play is marred: it goesnot forward, doth it?QUINCEIt is not possible: you have not a man in allAthens able to discharge Pyramus but he.FLUTENo, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman in Athens.QUINCEYea and the best person too; and he is a veryparamour for a sweet voice.FLUTEYou must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,a thing of naught.Enter SNUGSNUGMasters, the duke is coming from the temple, andthere is two or three lords and ladies more married:if our sport had gone forward, we had all been mademen.FLUTEO sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence aday during his life; he could not have 'scapedsixpence a day: an the duke had not given himsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;he would have deserved it: sixpence a day inPyramus, or nothing.Enter BOTTOMBOTTOMWhere are these lads? where are these hearts?QUINCEBottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!BOTTOMMasters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me notwhat; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. Iwill tell you every thing, right as it fell out.QUINCELet us hear, sweet Bottom.BOTTOMNot a word of me. All that I will tell you is, thatthe duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,good strings to your beards, new ribbons to yourpumps; meet presently at the palace; every man looko'er his part; for the short and the long is, ourplay is preferred. In any case, let Thisby haveclean linen; and let not him that plays the lionpair his nails, for they shall hang out for thelion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onionsnor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and Ido not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweetcomedy. No more words: away! go, away!ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and AttendantsHIPPOLYTA'Tis strange my Theseus, that theselovers speak of.THESEUSMore strange than true: I never may believeThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,Such shaping fantasies, that apprehendMore than cool reason ever comprehends.The lunatic, the lover and the poetAre of imagination all compact:One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;And as imagination bodies forthThe forms of things unknown, the poet's penTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothingA local habitation and a name.Such tricks hath strong imagination,That if it would but apprehend some joy,It comprehends some bringer of that joy;Or in the night, imagining some fear,How easy is a bush supposed a bear!HIPPOLYTABut all the story of the night told over,And all their minds transfigured so together,More witnesseth than fancy's imagesAnd grows to something of great constancy;But, howsoever, strange and admirable.THESEUSHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENAJoy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of loveAccompany your hearts!LYSANDERMore than to usWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!THESEUSCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,To wear away this long age of three hoursBetween our after-supper and bed-time?Where is our usual manager of mirth?What revels are in hand? Is there no play,To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?Call Philostrate.PHILOSTRATEHere, mighty Theseus.THESEUSSay, what abridgement have you for this evening?What masque? what music? How shall we beguileThe lazy time, if not with some delight?PHILOSTRATEThere is a brief how many sports are ripe:Make choice of which your highness will see first.Giving a paperTHESEUS[Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sungBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'We'll none of that: that have I told my love,In glory of my kinsman Hercules.Reads'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'That is an old device; and it was play'dWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.Reads'The thrice three Muses mourning for the deathOf Learning, late deceased in beggary.'That is some satire, keen and critical,Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.Reads'A tedious brief scene of young PyramusAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.How shall we find the concord of this discord?PHILOSTRATEA play there is, my lord, some ten words long,Which is as brief as I have known a play;But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,Which makes it tedious; for in all the playThere is not one word apt, one player fitted:And tragical, my noble lord, it is;For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,Made mine eyes water; but more merry tearsThe passion of loud laughter never shed.THESEUSWhat are they that do play it?PHILOSTRATEHard-handed men that work in Athens here,Which never labour'd in their minds till now,And now have toil'd their unbreathed memoriesWith this same play, against your nuptial.THESEUSAnd we will hear it.PHILOSTRATENo, my noble lord;It is not for you: I have heard it over,And it is nothing, nothing in the world;Unless you can find sport in their intents,Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,To do you service.THESEUSI will hear that play;For never anything can be amiss,When simpleness and duty tender it.Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.Exit PHILOSTRATEHIPPOLYTAI love not to see wretchedness o'er chargedAnd duty in his service perishing.THESEUSWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.HIPPOLYTAHe says they can do nothing in this kind.THESEUSThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:And what poor duty cannot do, noble respectTakes it in might, not merit.Where I have come, great clerks have purposedTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,Make periods in the midst of sentences,Throttle their practised accent in their fearsAnd in conclusion dumbly have broke off,Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;And in the modesty of fearful dutyI read as much as from the rattling tongueOf saucy and audacious eloquence.Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicityIn least speak most, to my capacity.Re-enter PHILOSTRATEPHILOSTRATESo please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.THESEUSLet him approach.Flourish of trumpetsEnter QUINCE for the ProloguePrologueIf we offend, it is with our good will.That you should think, we come not to offend,But with good will. To show our simple skill,That is the true beginning of our end.Consider then we come but in despite.We do not come as minding to contest you,Our true intent is. All for your delightWe are not here. That you should here repent you,The actors are at hand and by their showYou shall know all that you are like to know.THESEUSThis fellow doth not stand upon points.LYSANDERHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knowsnot the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is notenough to speak, but to speak true.HIPPOLYTAIndeed he hath played on his prologue like a childon a recorder; a sound, but not in government.THESEUSHis speech, was like a tangled chain; nothingimpaired, but all disordered. Who is next?Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and LionPrologueGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.This man is Pyramus, if you would know;This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth presentWall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are contentTo whisper. At the which let no man wonder.This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,By moonshine did these lovers think no scornTo meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,Did scare away, or rather did affright;And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twainAt large discourse, while here they do remain.Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and MoonshineTHESEUSI wonder if the lion be to speak.DEMETRIUSNo wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.WallIn this same interlude it doth befallThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall;And such a wall, as I would have you think,That had in it a crannied hole or chink,Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,Did whisper often very secretly.This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth showThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:And this the cranny is, right and sinister,Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.THESEUSWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?DEMETRIUSIt is the wittiest partition that ever I hearddiscourse, my lord.Enter PyramusTHESEUSPyramus draws near the wall: silence!PyramusO grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!O night, which ever art when day is not!O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!Wall holds up his fingersThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!But what see I? No Thisby do I see.O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!THESEUSThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.PyramusNo, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am tospy her through the wall. You shall see, it willfall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.Enter ThisbeThisbeO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,For parting my fair Pyramus and me!My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.PyramusI see a voice: now will I to the chink,To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!ThisbeMy love thou art, my love I think.PyramusThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;And, like Limander, am I trusty still.ThisbeAnd I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.PyramusNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.ThisbeAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.PyramusO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!ThisbeI kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.PyramusWilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?Thisbe'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.Exeunt Pyramus and ThisbeWallThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.ExitTHESEUSNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.DEMETRIUSNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hearwithout warning.HIPPOLYTAThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.THESEUSThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worstare no worse, if imagination amend them.HIPPOLYTAIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.THESEUSIf we imagine no worse of them than they ofthemselves, they may pass for excellent men. Herecome two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.Enter Lion and MoonshineLionYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fearThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,May now perchance both quake and tremble here,When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, amA lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;For, if I should as lion come in strifeInto this place, 'twere pity on my life.THESEUSA very gentle beast, of a good conscience.DEMETRIUSThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.LYSANDERThis lion is a very fox for his valour.THESEUSTrue; and a goose for his discretion.DEMETRIUSNot so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry hisdiscretion; and the fox carries the goose.THESEUSHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.MoonshineThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--DEMETRIUSHe should have worn the horns on his head.THESEUSHe is no crescent, and his horns areinvisible within the circumference.MoonshineThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.THESEUSThis is the greatest error of all the rest: the manshould be put into the lanthorn. How is it else theman i' the moon?DEMETRIUSHe dares not come there for the candle; for, yousee, it is already in snuff.HIPPOLYTAI am aweary of this moon: would he would change!THESEUSIt appears, by his small light of discretion, thathe is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in allreason, we must stay the time.LYSANDERProceed, Moon.MoonshineAll that I have to say, is, to tell you that thelanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; thisthorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.DEMETRIUSWhy, all these should be in the lanthorn; for allthese are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.Enter ThisbeThisbeThis is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?Lion[Roaring] Oh--Thisbe runs offDEMETRIUSWell roared, Lion.THESEUSWell run, Thisbe.HIPPOLYTAWell shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with agood grace.The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exitTHESEUSWell moused, Lion.LYSANDERAnd so the lion vanished.DEMETRIUSAnd then came Pyramus.Enter PyramusPyramusSweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.But stay, O spite!But mark, poor knight,What dreadful dole is here!Eyes, do you see?How can it be?O dainty duck! O dear!Thy mantle good,What, stain'd with blood!Approach, ye Furies fell!O Fates, come, come,Cut thread and thrum;Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!THESEUSThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, wouldgo near to make a man look sad.HIPPOLYTABeshrew my heart, but I pity the man.PyramusO wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dameThat lived, that loved, that liked, that look'dwith cheer.Come, tears, confound;Out, sword, and woundThe pap of Pyramus;Ay, that left pap,Where heart doth hop:Stabs himselfThus die I, thus, thus, thus.Now am I dead,Now am I fled;My soul is in the sky:Tongue, lose thy light;Moon take thy flight:Exit MoonshineNow die, die, die, die, die.DiesDEMETRIUSNo die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.LYSANDERLess than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.THESEUSWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, andprove an ass.HIPPOLYTAHow chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comesback and finds her lover?THESEUSShe will find him by starlight. Here she comes; andher passion ends the play.Re-enter ThisbeHIPPOLYTAMethinks she should not use a long one for such aPyramus: I hope she will be brief.DEMETRIUSA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, whichThisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;she for a woman, God bless us.LYSANDERShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.DEMETRIUSAnd thus she means, videlicet:--ThisbeAsleep, my love?What, dead, my dove?O Pyramus, arise!Speak, speak. Quite dumb?Dead, dead? A tombMust cover thy sweet eyes.These My lips,This cherry nose,These yellow cowslip cheeks,Are gone, are gone:Lovers, make moan:His eyes were green as leeks.O Sisters Three,Come, come to me,With hands as pale as milk;Lay them in gore,Since you have shoreWith shears his thread of silk.Tongue, not a word:Come, trusty sword;Come, blade, my breast imbrue:Stabs herselfAnd, farewell, friends;Thus Thisby ends:Adieu, adieu, adieu.DiesTHESEUSMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.DEMETRIUSAy, and Wall too.BOTTOM[Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down thatparted their fathers. Will it please you to see theepilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between twoof our company?THESEUSNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs noexcuse. Never excuse; for when the players are alldead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if hethat writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himselfin Thisbe's garter, it would have been a finetragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notablydischarged. But come, your Bergomask: let yourepilogue alone.A danceThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.I fear we shall out-sleep the coming mornAs much as we this night have overwatch'd.This palpable-gross play hath well beguiledThe heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.A fortnight hold we this solemnity,In nightly revels and new jollity.ExeuntEnter PUCKPUCKNow the hungry lion roars,And the wolf behowls the moon;Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,All with weary task fordone.Now the wasted brands do glow,Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,Puts the wretch that lies in woeIn remembrance of a shroud.Now it is the time of nightThat the graves all gaping wide,Every one lets forth his sprite,In the church-way paths to glide:And we fairies, that do runBy the triple Hecate's team,From the presence of the sun,Following darkness like a dream,Now are frolic: not a mouseShall disturb this hallow'd house:I am sent with broom before,To sweep the dust behind the door.Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their trainOBERONThrough the house give gathering light,By the dead and drowsy fire:Every elf and fairy spriteHop as light as bird from brier;And this ditty, after me,Sing, and dance it trippingly.TITANIAFirst, rehearse your song by roteTo each word a warbling note:Hand in hand, with fairy grace,Will we sing, and bless this place.Song and danceOBERONNow, until the break of day,Through this house each fairy stray.To the best bride-bed will we,Which by us shall blessed be;And the issue there createEver shall be fortunate.So shall all the couples threeEver true in loving be;And the blots of Nature's handShall not in their issue stand;Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,Nor mark prodigious, such as areDespised in nativity,Shall upon their children be.With this field-dew consecrate,Every fairy take his gait;And each several chamber bless,Through this palace, with sweet peace;And the owner of it blestEver shall in safety rest.Trip away; make no stay;Meet me all by break of day.Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and trainPUCKIf we shadows have offended,Think but this, and all is mended,That you have but slumber'd hereWhile these visions did appear.And this weak and idle theme,No more yielding but a dream,Gentles, do not reprehend:if you pardon, we will mend:And, as I am an honest Puck,If we have unearned luckNow to 'scape the serpent's tongue,We will make amends ere long;Else the Puck a liar call;So, good night unto you all.Give me your hands, if we be friends,And Robin shall restore amends.ACT ISCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.Enter ORLANDO and ADAMORLANDOAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on hisblessing, to breed me well: and there begins mysadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, andreport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak moreproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call youthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, thatdiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horsesare bred better; for, besides that they are fairwith their feeding, they are taught their manage,and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, hisbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for thewhich his animals on his dunghills are as muchbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he soplentifully gives me, the something that nature gaveme his countenance seems to take from me: he letsme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of abrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines mygentility with my education. This is it, Adam, thatgrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which Ithink is within me, begins to mutiny against thisservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet Iknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.ADAMYonder comes my master, your brother.ORLANDOGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he willshake me up.Enter OLIVEROLIVERNow, sir! what make you here?ORLANDONothing: I am not taught to make any thing.OLIVERWhat mar you then, sir?ORLANDOMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which Godmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.OLIVERMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.ORLANDOShall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?What prodigal portion have I spent, that I shouldcome to such penury?OLIVERKnow you where your are, sir?ORLANDOO, sir, very well; here in your orchard.OLIVERKnow you before whom, sir?ORLANDOAy, better than him I am before knows me. I knowyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentlecondition of blood, you should so know me. Thecourtesy of nations allows you my better, in thatyou are the first-born; but the same traditiontakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothersbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me asyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me isnearer to his reverence.OLIVERWhat, boy!ORLANDOCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.OLIVERWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?ORLANDOI am no villain; I am the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thricea villain that says such a father begot villains.Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this handfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thytongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.ADAMSweet masters, be patient: for your father'sremembrance, be at accord.OLIVERLet me go, I say.ORLANDOI will not, till I please: you shall hear me. Myfather charged you in his will to give me goodeducation: you have trained me like a peasant,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-likequalities. The spirit of my father grows strong inme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allowme such exercises as may become a gentleman, orgive me the poor allottery my father left me bytestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.OLIVERAnd what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubledwith you; you shall have some part of your will: Ipray you, leave me.ORLANDOI will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.OLIVERGet you with him, you old dog.ADAMIs 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost myteeth in your service. God be with my old master!he would not have spoke such a word.Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAMOLIVERIs it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I willphysic your rankness, and yet give no thousandcrowns neither. Holla, Dennis!Enter DENNISDENNISCalls your worship?OLIVERWas not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?DENNISSo please you, he is here at the door and importunesaccess to you.OLIVERCall him in.Exit DENNIS'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.Enter CHARLESCHARLESGood morrow to your worship.OLIVERGood Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at thenew court?CHARLESThere's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:that is, the old duke is banished by his youngerbrother the new duke; and three or four loving lordshave put themselves into voluntary exile with him,whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;therefore he gives them good leave to wander.OLIVERCan you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, bebanished with her father?CHARLESO, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so lovesher, being ever from their cradles bred together,that she would have followed her exile, or have diedto stay behind her. She is at the court, and noless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; andnever two ladies loved as they do.OLIVERWhere will the old duke live?CHARLESThey say he is already in the forest of Arden, anda many merry men with him; and there they live likethe old Robin Hood of England: they say many younggentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the timecarelessly, as they did in the golden world.OLIVERWhat, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?CHARLESMarry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with amatter. I am given, sir, secretly to understandthat your younger brother Orlando hath a dispositionto come in disguised against me to try a fall.To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he thatescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit himwell. Your brother is but young and tender; and,for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as Imust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint youwithal, that either you might stay him from hisintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shallrun into, in that it is a thing of his own searchand altogether against my will.OLIVERCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, whichthou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I hadmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein andhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him fromit, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, fullof ambition, an envious emulator of every man'sgood parts, a secret and villanous contriver againstme his natural brother: therefore use thydiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neckas his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for ifthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do notmightily grace himself on thee, he will practiseagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by sometreacherous device and never leave thee till hehath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speakit, there is not one so young and so villanous thisday living. I speak but brotherly of him; butshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I mustblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.CHARLESI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he cometo-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he goalone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: andso God keep your worship!OLIVERFarewell, good Charles.Exit CHARLESNow will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall seean end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, neverschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, ofall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so muchin the heart of the world, and especially of my ownpeople, who best know him, that I am altogethermisprised: but it shall not be so long; thiswrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but thatI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.ExitSCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.Enter CELIA and ROSALINDCELIAI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.ROSALINDDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you couldteach me to forget a banished father, you must notlearn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.CELIAHerein I see thou lovest me not with the full weightthat I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thouhadst been still with me, I could have taught mylove to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteouslytempered as mine is to thee.ROSALINDWell, I will forget the condition of my estate, torejoice in yours.CELIAYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none islike to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shaltbe his heir, for what he hath taken away from thyfather perforce, I will render thee again inaffection; by mine honour, I will; and when I breakthat oath, let me turn monster: therefore, mysweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.ROSALINDFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Letme see; what think you of falling in love?CELIAMarry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: butlove no man in good earnest; nor no further in sportneither than with safety of a pure blush thou maystin honour come off again.ROSALINDWhat shall be our sport, then?CELIALet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune fromher wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.ROSALINDI would we could do so, for her benefits aremightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind womandoth most mistake in her gifts to women.CELIA'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarcemakes honest, and those that she makes honest shemakes very ill-favouredly.ROSALINDNay, now thou goest from Fortune's office toNature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,not in the lineaments of Nature.Enter TOUCHSTONECELIANo? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may shenot by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Naturehath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath notFortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?ROSALINDIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, whenFortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off ofNature's wit.CELIAPeradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, butNature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dullto reason of such goddesses and hath sent thisnatural for our whetstone; for always the dulness ofthe fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,wit! whither wander you?TOUCHSTONEMistress, you must come away to your father.CELIAWere you made the messenger?TOUCHSTONENo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.ROSALINDWhere learned you that oath, fool?TOUCHSTONEOf a certain knight that swore by his honour theywere good pancakes and swore by his honour themustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, thepancakes were naught and the mustard was good, andyet was not the knight forsworn.CELIAHow prove you that, in the great heap of yourknowledge?ROSALINDAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.TOUCHSTONEStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, andswear by your beards that I am a knave.CELIABy our beards, if we had them, thou art.TOUCHSTONEBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if youswear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: nomore was this knight swearing by his honour, for henever had any; or if he had, he had sworn it awaybefore ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.CELIAPrithee, who is't that thou meanest?TOUCHSTONEOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.CELIAMy father's love is enough to honour him: enough!speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxationone of these days.TOUCHSTONEThe more pity, that fools may not speak wisely whatwise men do foolishly.CELIABy my troth, thou sayest true; for since the littlewit that fools have was silenced, the little foolerythat wise men have makes a great show. Here comesMonsieur Le Beau.ROSALINDWith his mouth full of news.CELIAWhich he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.ROSALINDThen shall we be news-crammed.CELIAAll the better; we shall be the more marketable.Enter LE BEAUBon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?LE BEAUFair princess, you have lost much good sport.CELIASport! of what colour?LE BEAUWhat colour, madam! how shall I answer you?ROSALINDAs wit and fortune will.TOUCHSTONEOr as the Destinies decree.CELIAWell said: that was laid on with a trowel.TOUCHSTONENay, if I keep not my rank,--ROSALINDThou losest thy old smell.LE BEAUYou amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of goodwrestling, which you have lost the sight of.ROSALINDYou tell us the manner of the wrestling.LE BEAUI will tell you the beginning; and, if it pleaseyour ladyships, you may see the end; for the best isyet to do; and here, where you are, they are comingto perform it.CELIAWell, the beginning, that is dead and buried.LE BEAUThere comes an old man and his three sons,--CELIAI could match this beginning with an old tale.LE BEAUThree proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.ROSALINDWith bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all menby these presents.'LE BEAUThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, theduke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw himand broke three of his ribs, that there is littlehope of life in him: so he served the second, andso the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,their father, making such pitiful dole over themthat all the beholders take his part with weeping.ROSALINDAlas!TOUCHSTONEBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladieshave lost?LE BEAUWhy, this that I speak of.TOUCHSTONEThus men may grow wiser every day: it is the firsttime that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sportfor ladies.CELIAOr I, I promise thee.ROSALINDBut is there any else longs to see this broken musicin his sides? is there yet another dotes uponrib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?LE BEAUYou must, if you stay here; for here is the placeappointed for the wrestling, and they are ready toperform it.CELIAYonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and AttendantsDUKE FREDERICKCome on: since the youth will not be entreated, hisown peril on his forwardness.ROSALINDIs yonder the man?LE BEAUEven he, madam.CELIAAlas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.DUKE FREDERICKHow now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hitherto see the wrestling?ROSALINDAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.DUKE FREDERICKYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you;there is such odds in the man. In pity of thechallenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but hewill not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see ifyou can move him.CELIACall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.DUKE FREDERICKDo so: I'll not be by.LE BEAUMonsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.ORLANDOI attend them with all respect and duty.ROSALINDYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?ORLANDONo, fair princess; he is the general challenger: Icome but in, as others do, to try with him thestrength of my youth.CELIAYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for youryears. You have seen cruel proof of this man'sstrength: if you saw yourself with your eyes orknew yourself with your judgment, the fear of youradventure would counsel you to a more equalenterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, toembrace your own safety and give over this attempt.ROSALINDDo, young sir; your reputation shall not thereforebe misprised: we will make it our suit to the dukethat the wrestling might not go forward.ORLANDOI beseech you, punish me not with your hardthoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to denyso fair and excellent ladies any thing. But letyour fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to mytrial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but oneshamed that was never gracious; if killed, but onedead that was willing to be so: I shall do myfriends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, theworld no injury, for in it I have nothing; only inthe world I fill up a place, which may be bettersupplied when I have made it empty.ROSALINDThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.CELIAAnd mine, to eke out hers.ROSALINDFare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!CELIAYour heart's desires be with you!CHARLESCome, where is this young gallant that is sodesirous to lie with his mother earth?ORLANDOReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.DUKE FREDERICKYou shall try but one fall.CHARLESNo, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat himto a second, that have so mightily persuaded himfrom a first.ORLANDOAn you mean to mock me after, you should not havemocked me before: but come your ways.ROSALINDNow Hercules be thy speed, young man!CELIAI would I were invisible, to catch the strongfellow by the leg.They wrestleROSALINDO excellent young man!CELIAIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell whoshould down.Shout. CHARLES is thrownDUKE FREDERICKNo more, no more.ORLANDOYes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.DUKE FREDERICKHow dost thou, Charles?LE BEAUHe cannot speak, my lord.DUKE FREDERICKBear him away. What is thy name, young man?ORLANDOOrlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.DUKE FREDERICKI would thou hadst been son to some man else:The world esteem'd thy father honourable,But I did find him still mine enemy:Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,Hadst thou descended from another house.But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:I would thou hadst told me of another father.Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAUCELIAWere I my father, coz, would I do this?ORLANDOI am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,His youngest son; and would not change that calling,To be adopted heir to Frederick.ROSALINDMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,And all the world was of my father's mind:Had I before known this young man his son,I should have given him tears unto entreaties,Ere he should thus have ventured.CELIAGentle cousin,Let us go thank him and encourage him:My father's rough and envious dispositionSticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:If you do keep your promises in loveBut justly, as you have exceeded all promise,Your mistress shall be happy.ROSALINDGentleman,Giving him a chain from her neckWear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.Shall we go, coz?CELIAAy. Fare you well, fair gentleman.ORLANDOCan I not say, I thank you? My better partsAre all thrown down, and that which here stands upIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.ROSALINDHe calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrownMore than your enemies.CELIAWill you go, coz?ROSALINDHave with you. Fare you well.Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIAORLANDOWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.Re-enter LE BEAULE BEAUGood sir, I do in friendship counsel youTo leave this place. Albeit you have deservedHigh commendation, true applause and love,Yet such is now the duke's conditionThat he misconstrues all that you have done.The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.ORLANDOI thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:Which of the two was daughter of the dukeThat here was at the wrestling?LE BEAUNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners;But yet indeed the lesser is his daughterThe other is daughter to the banish'd duke,And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,To keep his daughter company; whose lovesAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.But I can tell you that of late this dukeHath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,Grounded upon no other argumentBut that the people praise her for her virtuesAnd pity her for her good father's sake;And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the ladyWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:Hereafter, in a better world than this,I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.ORLANDOI rest much bounden to you: fare you well.Exit LE BEAUThus must I from the smoke into the smother;From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:But heavenly Rosalind!ExitSCENE III. A room in the palace.Enter CELIA and ROSALINDCELIAWhy, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?ROSALINDNot one to throw at a dog.CELIANo, thy words are too precious to be cast away uponcurs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.ROSALINDThen there were two cousins laid up; when the oneshould be lamed with reasons and the other madwithout any.CELIABut is all this for your father?ROSALINDNo, some of it is for my child's father. O, howfull of briers is this working-day world!CELIAThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee inholiday foolery: if we walk not in the troddenpaths our very petticoats will catch them.ROSALINDI could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.CELIAHem them away.ROSALINDI would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.CELIACome, come, wrestle with thy affections.ROSALINDO, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!CELIAO, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, indespite of a fall. But, turning these jests out ofservice, let us talk in good earnest: is itpossible, on such a sudden, you should fall into sostrong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?ROSALINDThe duke my father loved his father dearly.CELIADoth it therefore ensue that you should love his sondearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hatenot Orlando.ROSALINDNo, faith, hate him not, for my sake.CELIAWhy should I not? doth he not deserve well?ROSALINDLet me love him for that, and do you love himbecause I do. Look, here comes the duke.CELIAWith his eyes full of anger.Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LordsDUKE FREDERICKMistress, dispatch you with your safest hasteAnd get you from our court.ROSALINDMe, uncle?DUKE FREDERICKYou, cousinWithin these ten days if that thou be'st foundSo near our public court as twenty miles,Thou diest for it.ROSALINDI do beseech your grace,Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:If with myself I hold intelligenceOr have acquaintance with mine own desires,If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,Never so much as in a thought unbornDid I offend your highness.DUKE FREDERICKThus do all traitors:If their purgation did consist in words,They are as innocent as grace itself:Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.ROSALINDYet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.DUKE FREDERICKThou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.ROSALINDSo was I when your highness took his dukedom;So was I when your highness banish'd him:Treason is not inherited, my lord;Or, if we did derive it from our friends,What's that to me? my father was no traitor:Then, good my liege, mistake me not so muchTo think my poverty is treacherous.CELIADear sovereign, hear me speak.DUKE FREDERICKAy, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,Else had she with her father ranged along.CELIAI did not then entreat to have her stay;It was your pleasure and your own remorse:I was too young that time to value her;But now I know her: if she be a traitor,Why so am I; we still have slept together,Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,Still we went coupled and inseparable.DUKE FREDERICKShe is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,Her very silence and her patienceSpeak to the people, and they pity her.Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuousWhen she is gone. Then open not thy lips:Firm and irrevocable is my doomWhich I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.CELIAPronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:I cannot live out of her company.DUKE FREDERICKYou are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,And in the greatness of my word, you die.Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and LordsCELIAO my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.ROSALINDI have more cause.CELIAThou hast not, cousin;Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the dukeHath banish'd me, his daughter?ROSALINDThat he hath not.CELIANo, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the loveWhich teacheth thee that thou and I am one:Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?No: let my father seek another heir.Therefore devise with me how we may fly,Whither to go and what to bear with us;And do not seek to take your change upon you,To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.ROSALINDWhy, whither shall we go?CELIATo seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.ROSALINDAlas, what danger will it be to us,Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.CELIAI'll put myself in poor and mean attireAnd with a kind of umber smirch my face;The like do you: so shall we pass alongAnd never stir assailants.ROSALINDWere it not better,Because that I am more than common tall,That I did suit me all points like a man?A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heartLie there what hidden woman's fear there will--We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,As many other mannish cowards haveThat do outface it with their semblances.CELIAWhat shall I call thee when thou art a man?ROSALINDI'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;And therefore look you call me Ganymede.But what will you be call'd?CELIASomething that hath a reference to my stateNo longer Celia, but Aliena.ROSALINDBut, cousin, what if we assay'd to stealThe clownish fool out of your father's court?Would he not be a comfort to our travel?CELIAHe'll go along o'er the wide world with me;Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,And get our jewels and our wealth together,Devise the fittest time and safest wayTo hide us from pursuit that will be madeAfter my flight. Now go we in contentTo liberty and not to banishment.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

Are not these woodsMore free from peril than the envious court?Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,The seasons' difference, as the icy fangAnd churlish chiding of the winter's wind,Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say'This is no flattery: these are counsellorsThat feelingly persuade me what I am.'Sweet are the uses of adversity,Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;And this our life exempt from public hauntFinds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,Sermons in stones and good in every thing.I would not change it.AMIENSHappy is your grace,That can translate the stubbornness of fortuneInto so quiet and so sweet a style.DUKE SENIORCome, shall we go and kill us venison?And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,Being native burghers of this desert city,Should in their own confines with forked headsHave their round haunches gored.First LordIndeed, my lord,The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,And, in that kind, swears you do more usurpThan doth your brother that hath banish'd you.To-day my Lord of Amiens and myselfDid steal behind him as he lay alongUnder an oak whose antique root peeps outUpon the brook that brawls along this wood:To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,The wretched animal heaved forth such groansThat their discharge did stretch his leathern coatAlmost to bursting, and the big round tearsCoursed one another down his innocent noseIn piteous chase; and thus the hairy foolMuch marked of the melancholy Jaques,Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,Augmenting it with tears.DUKE SENIORBut what said Jaques?Did he not moralize this spectacle?First LordO, yes, into a thousand similes.First, for his weeping into the needless stream;'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testamentAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of moreTo that which had too much:' then, being there alone,Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth partThe flux of company:' anon a careless herd,Full of the pasture, jumps along by himAnd never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you lookUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'Thus most invectively he pierceth throughThe body of the country, city, court,Yea, and of this our life, swearing that weAre mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,To fright the animals and to kill them upIn their assign'd and native dwelling-place.DUKE SENIORAnd did you leave him in this contemplation?Second LordWe did, my lord, weeping and commentingUpon the sobbing deer.DUKE SENIORShow me the place:I love to cope him in these sullen fits,For then he's full of matter.First LordI'll bring you to him straight.ExeuntSCENE II.

O you memoryOf old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?Why would you be so fond to overcomeThe bonny priser of the humorous duke?Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.Know you not, master, to some kind of menTheir graces serve them but as enemies?No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.O, what a world is this, when what is comelyEnvenoms him that bears it!ORLANDOWhy, what's the matter?ADAMO unhappy youth!Come not within these doors; within this roofThe enemy of all your graces lives:Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--Yet not the son, I will not call him sonOf him I was about to call his father--Hath heard your praises, and this night he meansTo burn the lodging where you use to lieAnd you within it: if he fail of that,He will have other means to cut you off.I overheard him and his practises.This is no place; this house is but a butchery:Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.ORLANDOWhy, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?ADAMNo matter whither, so you come not here.ORLANDOWhat, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?Or with a base and boisterous sword enforceA thievish living on the common road?This I must do, or know not what to do:Yet this I will not do, do how I can;I rather will subject me to the maliceOf a diverted blood and bloody brother.ADAMBut do not so. I have five hundred crowns,The thrifty hire I saved under your father,Which I did store to be my foster-nurseWhen service should in my old limbs lie lameAnd unregarded age in corners thrown:Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;For in my youth I never did applyHot and rebellious liquors in my blood,Nor did not with unbashful forehead wooThe means of weakness and debility;Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;I'll do the service of a younger manIn all your business and necessities.ORLANDOO good old man, how well in thee appearsThe constant service of the antique world,When service sweat for duty, not for meed!Thou art not for the fashion of these times,Where none will sweat but for promotion,And having that, do choke their service upEven with the having: it is not so with thee.But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,That cannot so much as a blossom yieldIn lieu of all thy pains and husbandryBut come thy ways; well go along together,And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,We'll light upon some settled low content.ADAMMaster, go on, and I will follow thee,To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.From seventeen years till now almost fourscoreHere lived I, but now live here no more.At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;But at fourscore it is too late a week:Yet fortune cannot recompense me betterThan to die well and not my master's debtor.ExeuntSCENE IV.

I remember, when I was in love I brokemy sword upon a stone and bid him take that forcoming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember thekissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that herpretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember thewooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooktwo cods and, giving her them again, said withweeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that aretrue lovers run into strange capers; but as all ismortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.ROSALINDThou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.TOUCHSTONENay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till Ibreak my shins against it.ROSALINDJove, Jove! this shepherd's passionIs much upon my fashion.TOUCHSTONEAnd mine; but it grows something stale with me.CELIAI pray you, one of you question yond manIf he for gold will give us any food:I faint almost to death.TOUCHSTONEHolla, you clown!ROSALINDPeace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.CORINWho calls?TOUCHSTONEYour betters, sir.CORINElse are they very wretched.ROSALINDPeace, I say. Good even to you, friend.CORINAnd to you, gentle sir, and to you all.ROSALINDI prithee, shepherd, if that love or goldCan in this desert place buy entertainment,Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'dAnd faints for succor.CORINFair sir, I pity herAnd wish, for her sake more than for mine own,My fortunes were more able to relieve her;But I am shepherd to another manAnd do not shear the fleeces that I graze:My master is of churlish dispositionAnd little recks to find the way to heavenBy doing deeds of hospitality:Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feedAre now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,By reason of his absence, there is nothingThat you will feed on; but what is, come see.And in my voice most welcome shall you be.ROSALINDWhat is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?CORINThat young swain that you saw here but erewhile,That little cares for buying any thing.ROSALINDI pray thee, if it stand with honesty,Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.CELIAAnd we will mend thy wages. I like this place.And willingly could waste my time in it.CORINAssuredly the thing is to be sold:Go with me: if you like upon reportThe soil, the profit and this kind of life,I will your very faithful feeder beAnd buy it with your gold right suddenly.ExeuntSCENE V. The Forest.Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and othersSONG.AMIENSUnder the greenwood treeWho loves to lie with me,And turn his merry noteUnto the sweet bird's throat,Come hither, come hither, come hither:Here shall he see No enemyBut winter and rough weather.JAQUESMore, more, I prithee, more.AMIENSIt will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.JAQUESI thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suckmelancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.More, I prithee, more.AMIENSMy voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.JAQUESI do not desire you to please me; I do desire you tosing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?AMIENSWhat you will, Monsieur Jaques.JAQUESNay, I care not for their names; they owe menothing. Will you sing?AMIENSMore at your request than to please myself.JAQUESWell then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;but that they call compliment is like the encounterof two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,methinks I have given him a penny and he renders methe beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that willnot, hold your tongues.AMIENSWell, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; theduke will drink under this tree. He hath been allthis day to look you.JAQUESAnd I have been all this day to avoid him. He istoo disputable for my company: I think of as manymatters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make noboast of them. Come, warble, come.SONG.Who doth ambition shunAll together hereAnd loves to live i' the sun,Seeking the food he eatsAnd pleased with what he gets,Come hither, come hither, come hither:Here shall he see No enemyBut winter and rough weather.JAQUESI'll give you a verse to this note that I madeyesterday in despite of my invention.AMIENSAnd I'll sing it.JAQUESThus it goes:--If it do come to passThat any man turn ass,Leaving his wealth and ease,A stubborn will to please,Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:Here shall he seeGross fools as he,An if he will come to me.AMIENSWhat's that 'ducdame'?JAQUES'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into acircle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'llrail against all the first-born of Egypt.AMIENSAnd I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.Exeunt severallySCENE VI. The forest.Enter ORLANDO and ADAMADAMDear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,kind master.ORLANDOWhy, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Livea little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, Iwill either be food for it or bring it for food tothee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile atthe arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;and if I bring thee not something to eat, I willgive thee leave to die: but if thou diest before Icome, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bearthee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die forlack of a dinner, if there live any thing in thisdesert. Cheerly, good Adam!ExeuntSCENE VII. The forest.A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlawsDUKE SENIORI think he be transform'd into a beast;For I can no where find him like a man.First LordMy lord, he is but even now gone hence:Here was he merry, hearing of a song.DUKE SENIORIf he, compact of jars, grow musical,We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.Enter JAQUESFirst LordHe saves my labour by his own approach.DUKE SENIORWhy, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,That your poor friends must woo your company?What, you look merrily!JAQUESA fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,A motley fool; a miserable world!As I do live by food, I met a foolWho laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,In good set terms and yet a motley fool.'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'And then he drew a dial from his poke,And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hearThe motley fool thus moral on the time,My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,That fools should be so deep-contemplative,And I did laugh sans intermissionAn hour by his dial. O noble fool!A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.DUKE SENIORWhat fool is this?JAQUESO worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,And says, if ladies be but young and fair,They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,Which is as dry as the remainder biscuitAfter a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'dWith observation, the which he ventsIn mangled forms. O that I were a fool!I am ambitious for a motley coat.DUKE SENIORThou shalt have one.JAQUESIt is my only suit;Provided that you weed your better judgmentsOf all opinion that grows rank in themThat I am wise. I must have libertyWithal, as large a charter as the wind,To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;And they that are most galled with my folly,They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:He that a fool doth very wisely hitDoth very foolishly, although he smart,Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,The wise man's folly is anatomizedEven by the squandering glances of the fool.Invest me in my motley; give me leaveTo speak my mind, and I will through and throughCleanse the foul body of the infected world,If they will patiently receive my medicine.DUKE SENIORFie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.JAQUESWhat, for a counter, would I do but good?DUKE SENIORMost mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:For thou thyself hast been a libertine,As sensual as the brutish sting itself;And all the embossed sores and headed evils,That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.JAQUESWhy, who cries out on pride,That can therein tax any private party?Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,Till that the weary very means do ebb?What woman in the city do I name,When that I say the city-woman bearsThe cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?Who can come in and say that I mean her,When such a one as she such is her neighbour?Or what is he of basest functionThat says his bravery is not of my cost,Thinking that I mean him, but therein suitsHis folly to the mettle of my speech?There then; how then? what then? Let me see whereinMy tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawnORLANDOForbear, and eat no more.JAQUESWhy, I have eat none yet.ORLANDONor shalt not, till necessity be served.JAQUESOf what kind should this cock come of?DUKE SENIORArt thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,Or else a rude despiser of good manners,That in civility thou seem'st so empty?ORLANDOYou touch'd my vein at first: the thorny pointOf bare distress hath ta'en from me the showOf smooth civility: yet am I inland bredAnd know some nurture. But forbear, I say:He dies that touches any of this fruitTill I and my affairs are answered.JAQUESAn you will not be answered with reason, I must die.DUKE SENIORWhat would you have? Your gentleness shall forceMore than your force move us to gentleness.ORLANDOI almost die for food; and let me have it.DUKE SENIORSit down and feed, and welcome to our table.ORLANDOSpeak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:I thought that all things had been savage here;And therefore put I on the countenanceOf stern commandment. But whate'er you areThat in this desert inaccessible,Under the shade of melancholy boughs,Lose and neglect the creeping hours of timeIf ever you have look'd on better days,If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,If ever sat at any good man's feast,If ever from your eyelids wiped a tearAnd know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.DUKE SENIORTrue is it that we have seen better days,And have with holy bell been knoll'd to churchAnd sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyesOf drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:And therefore sit you down in gentlenessAnd take upon command what help we haveThat to your wanting may be minister'd.ORLANDOThen but forbear your food a little while,Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawnAnd give it food. There is an old poor man,Who after me hath many a weary stepLimp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,I will not touch a bit.DUKE SENIORGo find him out,And we will nothing waste till you return.ORLANDOI thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!ExitDUKE SENIORThou seest we are not all alone unhappy:This wide and universal theatrePresents more woeful pageants than the sceneWherein we play in.JAQUESAll the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players:They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.And then the whining school-boy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lined,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion,Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAMDUKE SENIORWelcome. Set down your venerable burthen,And let him feed.ORLANDOI thank you most for him.ADAMSo had you need:I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.DUKE SENIORWelcome; fall to: I will not trouble youAs yet, to question you about your fortunes.Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.SONG.AMIENSBlow, blow, thou winter wind.Thou art not so unkindAs man's ingratitude;Thy tooth is not so keen,Because thou art not seen,Although thy breath be rude.Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:Then, heigh-ho, the holly!This life is most jolly.Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,That dost not bite so nighAs benefits forgot:Though thou the waters warp,Thy sting is not so sharpAs friend remember'd not.Heigh-ho! sing, & c.DUKE SENIORIf that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,And as mine eye doth his effigies witnessMost truly limn'd and living in your face,Be truly welcome hither: I am the dukeThat loved your father: the residue of your fortune,Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,Thou art right welcome as thy master is.Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,And let me all your fortunes understand.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. A room in the palace.Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVERDUKE FREDERICKNot see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:But were I not the better part made mercy,I should not seek an absent argumentOf my revenge, thou present. But look to it:Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;Seek him with candle; bring him dead or livingWithin this twelvemonth, or turn thou no moreTo seek a living in our territory.Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thineWorth seizure do we seize into our hands,Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouthOf what we think against thee.OLIVERO that your highness knew my heart in this!I never loved my brother in my life.DUKE FREDERICKMore villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;And let my officers of such a natureMake an extent upon his house and lands:Do this expediently and turn him going.ExeuntSCENE II. The forest.Enter ORLANDO, with a paperORLANDOHang there, my verse, in witness of my love:And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, surveyWith thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.O Rosalind! these trees shall be my booksAnd in their barks my thoughts I'll character;That every eye which in this forest looksShall see thy virtue witness'd every where.Run, run, Orlando; carve on every treeThe fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.ExitEnter CORIN and TOUCHSTONECORINAnd how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?TOUCHSTONETruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a goodlife, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, Ilike it very well; but in respect that it isprivate, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect itis in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but inrespect it is not in the court, it is tedious. Asis it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes muchagainst my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?CORINNo more but that I know the more one sickens theworse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,means and content is without three good friends;that the property of rain is to wet and fire toburn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that agreat cause of the night is lack of the sun; thathe that hath learned no wit by nature nor art maycomplain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.TOUCHSTONESuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever incourt, shepherd?CORINNo, truly.TOUCHSTONEThen thou art damned.CORINNay, I hope.TOUCHSTONETruly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, allon one side.CORINFor not being at court? Your reason.TOUCHSTONEWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawestgood manners; if thou never sawest good manners,then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness issin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlousstate, shepherd.CORINNot a whit, Touchstone: those that are good mannersat the court are as ridiculous in the country as thebehavior of the country is most mockable at thecourt. You told me you salute not at the court, butyou kiss your hands: that courtesy would beuncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.TOUCHSTONEInstance, briefly; come, instance.CORINWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and theirfells, you know, are greasy.TOUCHSTONEWhy, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is notthe grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat ofa man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.CORINBesides, our hands are hard.TOUCHSTONEYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.A more sounder instance, come.CORINAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery ofour sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? Thecourtier's hands are perfumed with civet.TOUCHSTONEMost shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of agood piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, andperpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, thevery uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.CORINYou have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.TOUCHSTONEWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!God make incision in thee! thou art raw.CORINSir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, getthat I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man'shappiness, glad of other men's good, content with myharm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewesgraze and my lambs suck.TOUCHSTONEThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewesand the rams together and to offer to get yourliving by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to abell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of atwelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,out of all reasonable match. If thou beest notdamned for this, the devil himself will have noshepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst'scape.CORINHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, readingROSALINDFrom the east to western Ind,No jewel is like Rosalind.Her worth, being mounted on the wind,Through all the world bears Rosalind.All the pictures fairest linedAre but black to Rosalind.Let no fair be kept in mindBut the fair of Rosalind.TOUCHSTONEI'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners andsuppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is theright butter-women's rank to market.ROSALINDOut, fool!TOUCHSTONEFor a taste:If a hart do lack a hind,Let him seek out Rosalind.If the cat will after kind,So be sure will Rosalind.Winter garments must be lined,So must slender Rosalind.They that reap must sheaf and bind;Then to cart with Rosalind.Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,Such a nut is Rosalind.He that sweetest rose will findMust find love's prick and Rosalind.This is the very false gallop of verses: why do youinfect yourself with them?ROSALINDPeace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.TOUCHSTONETruly, the tree yields bad fruit.ROSALINDI'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff itwith a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruiti' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be halfripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.TOUCHSTONEYou have said; but whether wisely or no, let theforest judge.Enter CELIA, with a writingROSALINDPeace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.CELIA[Reads]Why should this a desert be?For it is unpeopled? No:Tongues I'll hang on every tree,That shall civil sayings show:Some, how brief the life of manRuns his erring pilgrimage,That the stretching of a spanBuckles in his sum of age;Some, of violated vows'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:But upon the fairest boughs,Or at every sentence end,Will I Rosalinda write,Teaching all that read to knowThe quintessence of every spriteHeaven would in little show.Therefore Heaven Nature chargedThat one body should be fill'dWith all graces wide-enlarged:Nature presently distill'dHelen's cheek, but not her heart,Cleopatra's majesty,Atalanta's better part,Sad Lucretia's modesty.Thus Rosalind of many partsBy heavenly synod was devised,Of many faces, eyes and hearts,To have the touches dearest prized.Heaven would that she these gifts should have,And I to live and die her slave.ROSALINDO most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of lovehave you wearied your parishioners withal, and nevercried 'Have patience, good people!'CELIAHow now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.Go with him, sirrah.TOUCHSTONECome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONECELIADidst thou hear these verses?ROSALINDO, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some ofthem had in them more feet than the verses would bear.CELIAThat's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.ROSALINDAy, but the feet were lame and could not bearthemselves without the verse and therefore stoodlamely in the verse.CELIABut didst thou hear without wondering how thy nameshould be hanged and carved upon these trees?ROSALINDI was seven of the nine days out of the wonderbefore you came; for look here what I found on apalm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed sincePythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which Ican hardly remember.CELIATrow you who hath done this?ROSALINDIs it a man?CELIAAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.Change you colour?ROSALINDI prithee, who?CELIAO Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends tomeet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakesand so encounter.ROSALINDNay, but who is it?CELIAIs it possible?ROSALINDNay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,tell me who it is.CELIAO wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderfulwonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,out of all hooping!ROSALINDGood my complexion! dost thou think, though I amcaparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose inmy disposition? One inch of delay more is aSouth-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is itquickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldststammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed manout of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none atall. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth thatmay drink thy tidings.CELIASo you may put a man in your belly.ROSALINDIs he of God's making? What manner of man? Is hishead worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?CELIANay, he hath but a little beard.ROSALINDWhy, God will send more, if the man will bethankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, ifthou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.CELIAIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler'sheels and your heart both in an instant.ROSALINDNay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow andtrue maid.CELIAI' faith, coz, 'tis he.ROSALINDOrlando?CELIAOrlando.ROSALINDAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet andhose? What did he when thou sawest him? What saidhe? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makeshim here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou seehim again? Answer me in one word.CELIAYou must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis aword too great for any mouth of this age's size. Tosay ay and no to these particulars is more than toanswer in a catechism.ROSALINDBut doth he know that I am in this forest and inman's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did theday he wrestled?CELIAIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve thepropositions of a lover; but take a taste of myfinding him, and relish it with good observance.I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.ROSALINDIt may well be called Jove's tree, when it dropsforth such fruit.CELIAGive me audience, good madam.ROSALINDProceed.CELIAThere lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.ROSALINDThough it be pity to see such a sight, it wellbecomes the ground.CELIACry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvetsunseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.ROSALINDO, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.CELIAI would sing my song without a burden: thou bringestme out of tune.ROSALINDDo you not know I am a woman? when I think, I mustspeak. Sweet, say on.CELIAYou bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?Enter ORLANDO and JAQUESROSALIND'Tis he: slink by, and note him.JAQUESI thank you for your company; but, good faith, I hadas lief have been myself alone.ORLANDOAnd so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank youtoo for your society.JAQUESGod be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.ORLANDOI do desire we may be better strangers.JAQUESI pray you, mar no more trees with writinglove-songs in their barks.ORLANDOI pray you, mar no more of my verses with readingthem ill-favouredly.JAQUESRosalind is your love's name?ORLANDOYes, just.JAQUESI do not like her name.ORLANDOThere was no thought of pleasing you when she waschristened.JAQUESWhat stature is she of?ORLANDOJust as high as my heart.JAQUESYou are full of pretty answers. Have you not beenacquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned themout of rings?ORLANDONot so; but I answer you right painted cloth, fromwhence you have studied your questions.JAQUESYou have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made ofAtalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? andwe two will rail against our mistress the world andall our misery.ORLANDOI will chide no breather in the world but myself,against whom I know most faults.JAQUESThe worst fault you have is to be in love.ORLANDO'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.I am weary of you.JAQUESBy my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I foundyou.ORLANDOHe is drowned in the brook: look but in, and youshall see him.JAQUESThere I shall see mine own figure.ORLANDOWhich I take to be either a fool or a cipher.JAQUESI'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, goodSignior Love.ORLANDOI am glad of your departure: adieu, good MonsieurMelancholy.Exit JAQUESROSALIND[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucylackey and under that habit play the knave with him.Do you hear, forester?ORLANDOVery well: what would you?ROSALINDI pray you, what is't o'clock?ORLANDOYou should ask me what time o' day: there's no clockin the forest.ROSALINDThen there is no true lover in the forest; elsesighing every minute and groaning every hour woulddetect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.ORLANDOAnd why not the swift foot of Time? had not thatbeen as proper?ROSALINDBy no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces withdivers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambleswithal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallopswithal and who he stands still withal.ORLANDOI prithee, who doth he trot withal?ROSALINDMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between thecontract of her marriage and the day it issolemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length ofseven year.ORLANDOWho ambles Time withal?ROSALINDWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man thathath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily becausehe cannot study, and the other lives merrily becausehe feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of leanand wasteful learning, the other knowing no burdenof heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.ORLANDOWho doth he gallop withal?ROSALINDWith a thief to the gallows, for though he go assoftly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.ORLANDOWho stays it still withal?ROSALINDWith lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep betweenterm and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.ORLANDOWhere dwell you, pretty youth?ROSALINDWith this shepherdess, my sister; here in theskirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.ORLANDOAre you native of this place?ROSALINDAs the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.ORLANDOYour accent is something finer than you couldpurchase in so removed a dwelling.ROSALINDI have been told so of many: but indeed an oldreligious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who wasin his youth an inland man; one that knew courtshiptoo well, for there he fell in love. I have heardhim read many lectures against it, and I thank GodI am not a woman, to be touched with so manygiddy offences as he hath generally taxed theirwhole sex withal.ORLANDOCan you remember any of the principal evils that helaid to the charge of women?ROSALINDThere were none principal; they were all like oneanother as half-pence are, every one fault seemingmonstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.ORLANDOI prithee, recount some of them.ROSALINDNo, I will not cast away my physic but on those thatare sick. There is a man haunts the forest, thatabuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' ontheir barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegieson brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name ofRosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I wouldgive him some good counsel, for he seems to have thequotidian of love upon him.ORLANDOI am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell meyour remedy.ROSALINDThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you: hetaught me how to know a man in love; in which cageof rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.ORLANDOWhat were his marks?ROSALINDA lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye andsunken, which you have not, an unquestionablespirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,which you have not; but I pardon you for that, forsimply your having in beard is a younger brother'srevenue: then your hose should be ungartered, yourbonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoeuntied and every thing about you demonstrating acareless desolation; but you are no such man; youare rather point-device in your accoutrements asloving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.ORLANDOFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.ROSALINDMe believe it! you may as soon make her that youlove believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter todo than to confess she does: that is one of thepoints in the which women still give the lie totheir consciences. But, in good sooth, are you hethat hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalindis so admired?ORLANDOI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand ofRosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.ROSALINDBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?ORLANDONeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.ROSALINDLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deservesas well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: andthe reason why they are not so punished and curedis, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippersare in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.ORLANDODid you ever cure any so?ROSALINDYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine mehis love, his mistress; and I set him every day towoo me: at which time would I, being but a moonishyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longingand liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for everypassion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most partcattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathehim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weepfor him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitorfrom his mad humour of love to a living humour ofmadness; which was, to forswear the full stream ofthe world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.And thus I cured him; and this way will I take uponme to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep'sheart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.ORLANDOI would not be cured, youth.ROSALINDI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalindand come every day to my cote and woo me.ORLANDONow, by the faith of my love, I will: tell mewhere it is.ROSALINDGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the wayyou shall tell me where in the forest you live.Will you go?ORLANDOWith all my heart, good youth.ROSALINDNay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?ExeuntSCENE III. The forest.Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behindTOUCHSTONECome apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up yourgoats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?doth my simple feature content you?AUDREYYour features! Lord warrant us! what features!TOUCHSTONEI am here with thee and thy goats, as the mostcapricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.JAQUES[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jovein a thatched house!TOUCHSTONEWhen a man's verses cannot be understood, nor aman's good wit seconded with the forward childUnderstanding, it strikes a man more dead than agreat reckoning in a little room. Truly, I wouldthe gods had made thee poetical.AUDREYI do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest indeed and word? is it a true thing?TOUCHSTONENo, truly; for the truest poetry is the mostfeigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and whatthey swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.AUDREYDo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?TOUCHSTONEI do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou arthonest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have somehope thou didst feign.AUDREYWould you not have me honest?TOUCHSTONENo, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; forhonesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.JAQUES[Aside] A material fool!AUDREYWell, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the godsmake me honest.TOUCHSTONETruly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slutwere to put good meat into an unclean dish.AUDREYI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.TOUCHSTONEWell, praised be the gods for thy foulness!sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it maybe, I will marry thee, and to that end I have beenwith Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the nextvillage, who hath promised to meet me in this placeof the forest and to couple us.JAQUES[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.AUDREYWell, the gods give us joy!TOUCHSTONEAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,stagger in this attempt; for here we have no templebut the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But whatthough? C ourage! As horns are odious, they arenecessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end ofhis goods:' right; many a man has good horns, andknows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry ofhis wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deerhath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single mantherefore blessed? No: as a walled town is moreworthier than a village, so is the forehead of amarried man more honourable than the bare brow of abachelor; and by how much defence is better than noskill, by so much is a horn more precious than towant. Here comes Sir Oliver.Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXTSir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will youdispatch us here under this tree, or shall we gowith you to your chapel?SIR OLIVER MARTEXTIs there none here to give the woman?TOUCHSTONEI will not take her on gift of any man.SIR OLIVER MARTEXTTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.JAQUES[Advancing]Proceed, proceed I'll give her.TOUCHSTONEGood even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for yourlast company: I am very glad to see you: even atoy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.JAQUESWill you be married, motley?TOUCHSTONEAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb andthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; andas pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.JAQUESAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, bemarried under a bush like a beggar? Get you tochurch, and have a good priest that can tell youwhat marriage is: this fellow will but join youtogether as they join wainscot; then one of you willprove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.TOUCHSTONE[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to bemarried of him than of another: for he is not liketo marry me well; and not being well married, itwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.JAQUESGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.TOUCHSTONE'Come, sweet Audrey:We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--O sweet Oliver,O brave Oliver,Leave me not behind thee: but,--Wind away,Begone, I say,I will not to wedding with thee.Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREYSIR OLIVER MARTEXT'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of themall shall flout me out of my calling.ExitSCENE IV. The forest.Enter ROSALIND and CELIAROSALINDNever talk to me; I will weep.CELIADo, I prithee; but yet have the grace to considerthat tears do not become a man.ROSALINDBut have I not cause to weep?CELIAAs good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.ROSALINDHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.CELIASomething browner than Judas's marry, his kisses areJudas's own children.ROSALINDI' faith, his hair is of a good colour.CELIAAn excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.ROSALINDAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touchof holy bread.CELIAHe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nunof winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;the very ice of chastity is in them.ROSALINDBut why did he swear he would come this morning, andcomes not?CELIANay, certainly, there is no truth in him.ROSALINDDo you think so?CELIAYes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor ahorse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I dothink him as concave as a covered goblet or aworm-eaten nut.ROSALINDNot true in love?CELIAYes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.ROSALINDYou have heard him swear downright he was.CELIA'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover isno stronger than the word of a tapster; they areboth the confirmer of false reckonings. He attendshere in the forest on the duke your father.ROSALINDI met the duke yesterday and had much question withhim: he asked me of what parentage I was; I toldhim, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.But what talk we of fathers, when there is such aman as Orlando?CELIAO, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaksthem bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart ofhis lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horsebut on one side, breaks his staff like a noblegoose: but all's brave that youth mounts and follyguides. Who comes here?Enter CORINCORINMistress and master, you have oft inquiredAfter the shepherd that complain'd of love,Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,Praising the proud disdainful shepherdessThat was his mistress.CELIAWell, and what of him?CORINIf you will see a pageant truly play'd,Between the pale complexion of true loveAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,If you will mark it.ROSALINDO, come, let us remove:The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.Bring us to this sight, and you shall sayI'll prove a busy actor in their play.ExeuntSCENE V. Another part of the forest.Enter SILVIUS and PHEBESILVIUSSweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;Say that you love me not, but say not soIn bitterness. The common executioner,Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,Falls not the axe upon the humbled neckBut first begs pardon: will you sterner beThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops?Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behindPHEBEI would not be thy executioner:I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,Who shut their coward gates on atomies,Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remainsSome scar of it; lean but upon a rush,The cicatrice and capable impressureThy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyesThat can do hurt.SILVIUSO dear Phebe,If ever,--as that ever may be near,--You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,Then shall you know the wounds invisibleThat love's keen arrows make.PHEBEBut till that timeCome not thou near me: and when that time comes,Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;As till that time I shall not pity thee.ROSALINDAnd why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,That you insult, exult, and all at once,Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--As, by my faith, I see no more in youThan without candle may go dark to bed--Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?I see no more in you than in the ordinaryOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,I think she means to tangle my eyes too!No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,That can entame my spirits to your worship.You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?You are a thousand times a properer manThan she a woman: 'tis such fools as youThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;And out of you she sees herself more properThan any of her lineaments can show her.But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:For I must tell you friendly in your ear,Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.PHEBESweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.ROSALINDHe's fallen in love with your foulness and she'llfall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast asshe answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce herwith bitter words. Why look you so upon me?PHEBEFor no ill will I bear you.ROSALINDI pray you, do not fall in love with me,For I am falser than vows made in wine:Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,And be not proud: though all the world could see,None could be so abused in sight as he.Come, to our flock.Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORINPHEBEDead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'SILVIUSSweet Phebe,--PHEBEHa, what say'st thou, Silvius?SILVIUSSweet Phebe, pity me.PHEBEWhy, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.SILVIUSWherever sorrow is, relief would be:If you do sorrow at my grief in love,By giving love your sorrow and my griefWere both extermined.PHEBEThou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?SILVIUSI would have you.PHEBEWhy, that were covetousness.Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,And yet it is not that I bear thee love;But since that thou canst talk of love so well,Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:But do not look for further recompenseThan thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.SILVIUSSo holy and so perfect is my love,And I in such a poverty of grace,That I shall think it a most plenteous cropTo glean the broken ears after the manThat the main harvest reaps: loose now and thenA scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.PHEBEKnow'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?SILVIUSNot very well, but I have met him oft;And he hath bought the cottage and the boundsThat the old carlot once was master of.PHEBEThink not I love him, though I ask for him:'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;But what care I for words? yet words do wellWhen he that speaks them pleases those that hear.It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:He'll make a proper man: the best thing in himIs his complexion; and faster than his tongueDid make offence his eye did heal it up.He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:There was a pretty redness in his lip,A little riper and more lusty redThan that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the differenceBetween the constant red and mingled damask.There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd himIn parcels as I did, would have gone nearTo fall in love with him; but, for my part,I love him not nor hate him not; and yetI have more cause to hate him than to love him:For what had he to do to chide at me?He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:I marvel why I answer'd not again:But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.I'll write to him a very taunting letter,And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?SILVIUSPhebe, with all my heart.PHEBEI'll write it straight;The matter's in my head and in my heart:I will be bitter with him and passing short.Go with me, Silvius.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. The forest.Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUESJAQUESI prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquaintedwith thee.ROSALINDThey say you are a melancholy fellow.JAQUESI am so; I do love it better than laughing.ROSALINDThose that are in extremity of either are abominablefellows and betray themselves to every moderncensure worse than drunkards.JAQUESWhy, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.ROSALINDWhy then, 'tis good to be a post.JAQUESI have neither the scholar's melancholy, which isemulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor thesoldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, northe lover's, which is all these: but it is amelancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry'scontemplation of my travels, in which my oftenrumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.ROSALINDA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason tobe sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to seeother men's; then, to have seen much and to havenothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.JAQUESYes, I have gained my experience.ROSALINDAnd your experience makes you sad: I had rather havea fool to make me merry than experience to make mesad; and to travel for it too!Enter ORLANDOORLANDOGood day and happiness, dear Rosalind!JAQUESNay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.ExitROSALINDFarewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp andwear strange suits, disable all the benefits of yourown country, be out of love with your nativity andalmost chide God for making you that countenance youare, or I will scarce think you have swam in agondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you beenall this while? You a lover! An you serve me suchanother trick, never come in my sight more.ORLANDOMy fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.ROSALINDBreak an hour's promise in love! He that willdivide a minute into a thousand parts and break buta part of the thousandth part of a minute in theaffairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupidhath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warranthim heart-whole.ORLANDOPardon me, dear Rosalind.ROSALINDNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: Ihad as lief be wooed of a snail.ORLANDOOf a snail?ROSALINDAy, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, hecarries his house on his head; a better jointure,I think, than you make a woman: besides he bringshis destiny with him.ORLANDOWhat's that?ROSALINDWhy, horns, which such as you are fain to bebeholding to your wives for: but he comes armed inhis fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.ORLANDOVirtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.ROSALINDAnd I am your Rosalind.CELIAIt pleases him to call you so; but he hath aRosalind of a better leer than you.ROSALINDCome, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holidayhumour and like enough to consent. What would yousay to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?ORLANDOI would kiss before I spoke.ROSALINDNay, you were better speak first, and when you weregravelled for lack of matter, you might takeoccasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they areout, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--Godwarn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.ORLANDOHow if the kiss be denied?ROSALINDThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.ORLANDOWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?ROSALINDMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, orI should think my honesty ranker than my wit.ORLANDOWhat, of my suit?ROSALINDNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.Am not I your Rosalind?ORLANDOI take some joy to say you are, because I would betalking of her.ROSALINDWell in her person I say I will not have you.ORLANDOThen in mine own person I die.ROSALINDNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world isalmost six thousand years old, and in all this timethere was not any man died in his own person,videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brainsdashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what hecould to die before, and he is one of the patternsof love. Leander, he would have lived many a fairyear, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not beenfor a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he wentbut forth to wash him in the Hellespont and beingtaken with the cramp was drowned and the foolishcoroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'But these are all lies: men have died from time totime and worms have eaten them, but not for love.ORLANDOI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,for, I protest, her frown might kill me.ROSALINDBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, nowI will be your Rosalind in a more coming-ondisposition, and ask me what you will. I will grantit.ORLANDOThen love me, Rosalind.ROSALINDYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.ORLANDOAnd wilt thou have me?ROSALINDAy, and twenty such.ORLANDOWhat sayest thou?ROSALINDAre you not good?ORLANDOI hope so.ROSALINDWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?ORLANDOPray thee, marry us.CELIAI cannot say the words.ROSALINDYou must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'CELIAGo to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?ORLANDOI will.ROSALINDAy, but when?ORLANDOWhy now; as fast as she can marry us.ROSALINDThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'ORLANDOI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.ROSALINDI might ask you for your commission; but I do takethee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goesbefore the priest; and certainly a woman's thoughtruns before her actions.ORLANDOSo do all thoughts; they are winged.ROSALINDNow tell me how long you would have her after youhave possessed her.ORLANDOFor ever and a day.ROSALINDSay 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;men are April when they woo, December when they wed:maids are May when they are maids, but the skychanges when they are wives. I will be more jealousof thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,more clamorous than a parrot against rain, morenew-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desiresthan a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Dianain the fountain, and I will do that when you aredisposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, andthat when thou art inclined to sleep.ORLANDOBut will my Rosalind do so?ROSALINDBy my life, she will do as I do.ORLANDOO, but she is wise.ROSALINDOr else she could not have the wit to do this: thewiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman'swit and it will out at the casement; shut that and'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill flywith the smoke out at the chimney.ORLANDOA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say'Wit, whither wilt?'ROSALINDNay, you might keep that cheque for it till you metyour wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.ORLANDOAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?ROSALINDMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shallnever take her without her answer, unless you takeher without her tongue. O, that woman that cannotmake her fault her husband's occasion, let hernever nurse her child herself, for she will breedit like a fool!ORLANDOFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.ROSALINDAlas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.ORLANDOI must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock Iwill be with thee again.ROSALINDAy, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what youwould prove: my friends told me as much, and Ithought no less: that flattering tongue of yourswon me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,death! Two o'clock is your hour?ORLANDOAy, sweet Rosalind.ROSALINDBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mendme, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,if you break one jot of your promise or come oneminute behind your hour, I will think you the mostpathetical break-promise and the most hollow loverand the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind thatmay be chosen out of the gross band of theunfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keepyour promise.ORLANDOWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed myRosalind: so adieu.ROSALINDWell, Time is the old justice that examines all suchoffenders, and let Time try: adieu.Exit ORLANDOCELIAYou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:we must have your doublet and hose plucked over yourhead, and show the world what the bird hath done toher own nest.ROSALINDO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thoudidst know how many fathom deep I am in love! Butit cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknownbottom, like the bay of Portugal.CELIAOr rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pouraffection in, it runs out.ROSALINDNo, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begotof thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyesbecause his own are out, let him be judge how deep Iam in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be outof the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow andsigh till he come.CELIAAnd I'll sleep.ExeuntSCENE II. The forest.Enter JAQUES, Lords, and ForestersJAQUESWhich is he that killed the deer?A LordSir, it was I.JAQUESLet's present him to the duke, like a Romanconqueror; and it would do well to set the deer'shorns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Haveyou no song, forester, for this purpose?ForesterYes, sir.JAQUESSing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so itmake noise enough.SONG.ForesterWhat shall he have that kill'd the deer?His leather skin and horns to wear.Then sing him home;The rest shall bear this burdenTake thou no scorn to wear the horn;It was a crest ere thou wast born:Thy father's father wore it,And thy father bore it:The horn, the horn, the lusty hornIs not a thing to laugh to scorn.ExeuntSCENE III. The forest.Enter ROSALIND and CELIAROSALINDHow say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? andhere much Orlando!CELIAI warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, hehath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth tosleep. Look, who comes here.Enter SILVIUSSILVIUSMy errand is to you, fair youth;My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:I know not the contents; but, as I guessBy the stern brow and waspish actionWhich she did use as she was writing of it,It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:I am but as a guiltless messenger.ROSALINDPatience herself would startle at this letterAnd play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,This is a letter of your own device.SILVIUSNo, I protest, I know not the contents:Phebe did write it.ROSALINDCome, come, you are a foolAnd turn'd into the extremity of love.I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did thinkThat her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:I say she never did invent this letter;This is a man's invention and his hand.SILVIUSSure, it is hers.ROSALINDWhy, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brainCould not drop forth such giant-rude inventionSuch Ethiope words, blacker in their effectThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?SILVIUSSo please you, for I never heard it yet;Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.ROSALINDShe Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.ReadsArt thou god to shepherd turn'd,That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?Can a woman rail thus?SILVIUSCall you this railing?ROSALIND[Reads]Why, thy godhead laid apart,Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?Did you ever hear such railing?Whiles the eye of man did woo me,That could do no vengeance to me.Meaning me a beast.If the scorn of your bright eyneHave power to raise such love in mine,Alack, in me what strange effectWould they work in mild aspect!Whiles you chid me, I did love;How then might your prayers move!He that brings this love to theeLittle knows this love in me:And by him seal up thy mind;Whether that thy youth and kindWill the faithful offer takeOf me and all that I can make;Or else by him my love deny,And then I'll study how to die.SILVIUSCall you this chiding?CELIAAlas, poor shepherd!ROSALINDDo you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wiltthou love such a woman? What, to make thee aninstrument and play false strains upon thee! not tobe endured! Well, go your way to her, for I seelove hath made thee a tame snake, and say this toher: that if she love me, I charge her to lovethee; if she will not, I will never have her unlessthou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.Exit SILVIUSEnter OLIVEROLIVERGood morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,Where in the purlieus of this forest standsA sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?CELIAWest of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:The rank of osiers by the murmuring streamLeft on your right hand brings you to the place.But at this hour the house doth keep itself;There's none within.OLIVERIf that an eye may profit by a tongue,Then should I know you by description;Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,Of female favour, and bestows himselfLike a ripe sister: the woman lowAnd browner than her brother.' Are not youThe owner of the house I did inquire for?CELIAIt is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.OLIVEROrlando doth commend him to you both,And to that youth he calls his RosalindHe sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?ROSALINDI am: what must we understand by this?OLIVERSome of my shame; if you will know of meWhat man I am, and how, and why, and whereThis handkercher was stain'd.CELIAI pray you, tell it.OLIVERWhen last the young Orlando parted from youHe left a promise to return againWithin an hour, and pacing through the forest,Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,And mark what object did present itself:Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with ageAnd high top bald with dry antiquity,A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,Lay sleeping on his back: about his neckA green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,Who with her head nimble in threats approach'dThe opening of his mouth; but suddenly,Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,And with indented glides did slip awayInto a bush: under which bush's shadeA lioness, with udders all drawn dry,Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tisThe royal disposition of that beastTo prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:This seen, Orlando did approach the manAnd found it was his brother, his elder brother.CELIAO, I have heard him speak of that same brother;And he did render him the most unnaturalThat lived amongst men.OLIVERAnd well he might so do,For well I know he was unnatural.ROSALINDBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there,Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?OLIVERTwice did he turn his back and purposed so;But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,And nature, stronger than his just occasion,Made him give battle to the lioness,Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtlingFrom miserable slumber I awaked.CELIAAre you his brother?ROSALINDWast you he rescued?CELIAWas't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?OLIVER'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shameTo tell you what I was, since my conversionSo sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.ROSALINDBut, for the bloody napkin?OLIVERBy and by.When from the first to last betwixt us twoTears our recountments had most kindly bathed,As how I came into that desert place:--In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,Committing me unto my brother's love;Who led me instantly unto his cave,There stripp'd himself, and here upon his armThe lioness had torn some flesh away,Which all this while had bled; and now he faintedAnd cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;And, after some small space, being strong at heart,He sent me hither, stranger as I am,To tell this story, that you might excuseHis broken promise, and to give this napkinDyed in his blood unto the shepherd youthThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind.ROSALIND swoonsCELIAWhy, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!OLIVERMany will swoon when they do look on blood.CELIAThere is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!OLIVERLook, he recovers.ROSALINDI would I were at home.CELIAWe'll lead you thither.I pray you, will you take him by the arm?OLIVERBe of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack aman's heart.ROSALINDI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body wouldthink this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tellyour brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!OLIVERThis was not counterfeit: there is too greattestimony in your complexion that it was a passionof earnest.ROSALINDCounterfeit, I assure you.OLIVERWell then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.ROSALINDSo I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.CELIACome, you look paler and paler: pray you, drawhomewards. Good sir, go with us.OLIVERThat will I, for I must bear answer backHow you excuse my brother, Rosalind.ROSALINDI shall devise something: but, I pray you, commendmy counterfeiting to him.

Art thou wise?WILLIAMAy, sir, I have a pretty wit.TOUCHSTONEWhy, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise manknows himself to be a fool.' The heathenphilosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat andlips to open. You do love this maid?WILLIAMI do, sir.TOUCHSTONEGive me your hand. Art thou learned?WILLIAMNo, sir.TOUCHSTONEThen learn this of me: to have, is to have; for itis a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured outof a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth emptythe other; for all your writers do consent that ipseis he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.WILLIAMWhich he, sir?TOUCHSTONEHe, sir, that must marry this woman.

But, O, how bitter a thing itis to look into happiness through another man'seyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be atthe height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shallthink my brother happy in having what he wishes for.ROSALINDWhy then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?ORLANDOI can live no longer by thinking.ROSALINDI will weary you then no longer with idle talking.Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: Ispeak not this that you should bear a good opinionof my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may insome little measure draw a belief from you, to doyourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, ifyou please, that I can do strange things: I have,since I was three year old, conversed with amagician, most profound in his art and yet notdamnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heartas your gesture cries it out, when your brothermarries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know intowhat straits of fortune she is driven; and it isnot impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenientto you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow humanas she is and without any danger.ORLANDOSpeakest thou in sober meanings?ROSALINDBy my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though Isay I am a magician. Therefore, put you in yourbest array: bid your friends; for if you will bemarried to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.Enter SILVIUS and PHEBELook, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.PHEBEYouth, you have done me much ungentleness,To show the letter that I writ to you.ROSALINDI care not if I have: it is my studyTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you:You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;Look upon him, love him; he worships you.PHEBEGood shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of sighs and tears;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd I for no woman.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of faith and service;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd I for no woman.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of fantasy,All made of passion and all made of wishes,All adoration, duty, and observance,All humbleness, all patience and impatience,All purity, all trial, all observance;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd so am I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd so am I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd so am I for no woman.PHEBEIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?SILVIUSIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?ORLANDOIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?ROSALINDWho do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'ORLANDOTo her that is not here, nor doth not hear.ROSALINDPray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howlingof Irish wolves against the moon.To SILVIUSI will help you, if I can:To PHEBEI would love you, if I could.

Here comes a pair ofvery strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.TOUCHSTONESalutation and greeting to you all!JAQUESGood my lord, bid him welcome: this is themotley-minded gentleman that I have so often met inthe forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.TOUCHSTONEIf any man doubt that, let him put me to mypurgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattereda lady; I have been politic with my friend, smoothwith mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I havehad four quarrels, and like to have fought one.JAQUESAnd how was that ta'en up?TOUCHSTONEFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon theseventh cause.JAQUESHow seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.DUKE SENIORI like him very well.TOUCHSTONEGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. Ipress in here, sir, amongst the rest of the countrycopulatives, to swear and to forswear: according asmarriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poorhumour of mine, sir, to take that that no man elsewill: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in apoor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.DUKE SENIORBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.TOUCHSTONEAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.JAQUESBut, for the seventh cause; how did you find thequarrel on the seventh cause?TOUCHSTONEUpon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body moreseeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike thecut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in themind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' hewould send me word, he cut it to please himself:this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it wasnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this iscalled the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was notwell cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: thisis called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was notwell cut,' he would say I lied: this is called theCounter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the LieCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.JAQUESAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?TOUCHSTONEI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so wemeasured swords and parted.JAQUESCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?TOUCHSTONEO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you havebooks for good manners: I will name you the degrees.The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, theQuip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; thefourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, theCountercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie withCircumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. Allthese you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you mayavoid that too, with an If. I knew when sevenjustices could not take up a quarrel, but when theparties were met themselves, one of them thought butof an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' andthey shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is theonly peacemaker; much virtue in If.JAQUESIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good atany thing and yet a fool.DUKE SENIORHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse and underthe presentation of that he shoots his wit.Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIAStill MusicHYMENThen is there mirth in heaven,When earthly things made evenAtone together.Good duke, receive thy daughterHymen from heaven brought her,Yea, brought her hither,That thou mightst join her hand with hisWhose heart within his bosom is.ROSALIND[To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.To ORLANDOTo you I give myself, for I am yours.DUKE SENIORIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.ORLANDOIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.PHEBEIf sight and shape be true,Why then, my love adieu!ROSALINDI'll have no father, if you be not he:I'll have no husband, if you be not he:Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.HYMENPeace, ho!

This to be true,I do engage my life.DUKE SENIORWelcome, young man;Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:To one his lands withheld, and to the otherA land itself at large, a potent dukedom.First, in this forest, let us do those endsThat here were well begun and well begot:And after, every of this happy numberThat have endured shrewd days and nights with usShall share the good of our returned fortune,According to the measure of their states.Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignityAnd fall into our rustic revelry.Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.JAQUESSir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,The duke hath put on a religious lifeAnd thrown into neglect the pompous court?JAQUES DE BOYSHe hath.JAQUESTo him will I : out of these convertitesThere is much matter to be heard and learn'd.To DUKE SENIORYou to your former honour I bequeath;Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:To ORLANDOYou to a love that your true faith doth merit:To OLIVERYou to your land and love and great allies:To SILVIUSYou to a long and well-deserved bed:To TOUCHSTONEAnd you to wrangling; for thy loving voyageIs but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:I am for other than for dancing measures.DUKE SENIORStay, Jaques, stay.JAQUESTo see no pastime I what you would haveI'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.ExitDUKE SENIORProceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.A danceEPILOGUEROSALINDIt is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lordthe prologue. If it be true that good wine needsno bush, 'tis true that a good play needs noepilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,and good plays prove the better by the help of goodepilogues. What a case am I in then, that amneither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate withyou in the behalf of a good play! I am notfurnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will notbecome me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll beginwith the women. I charge you, O women, for the loveyou bear to men, to like as much of this play asplease you: and I charge you, O men, for the loveyou bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,none of you hates them--that between you and thewomen the play may please. If I were a woman Iwould kiss as many of you as had beards that pleasedme, complexions that liked me and breaths that Idefied not: and, I am sure, as many as have goodbeards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for mykind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.ExeuntACT ISCENE I.

Poor souls, they perish'd.Had I been any god of power, I wouldHave sunk the sea within the earth or ereIt should the good ship so have swallow'd andThe fraughting souls within her.PROSPEROBe collected:No more amazement: tell your piteous heartThere's no harm done.MIRANDAO, woe the day!PROSPERONo harm.I have done nothing but in care of thee,Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, whoArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowingOf whence I am, nor that I am more betterThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,And thy no greater father.MIRANDAMore to knowDid never meddle with my thoughts.PROSPERO'Tis timeI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,And pluck my magic garment from me. So:Lays down his mantleLie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'dThe very virtue of compassion in thee,I have with such provision in mine artSo safely ordered that there is no soul--No, not so much perdition as an hairBetid to any creature in the vesselWhich thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;For thou must now know farther.MIRANDAYou have oftenBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp'dAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'PROSPEROThe hour's now come;The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;Obey and be attentive. Canst thou rememberA time before we came unto this cell?I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast notOut three years old.MIRANDACertainly, sir, I can.PROSPEROBy what? by any other house or person?Of any thing the image tell me thatHath kept with thy remembrance.MIRANDA'Tis far offAnd rather like a dream than an assuranceThat my remembrance warrants. Had I notFour or five women once that tended me?PROSPEROThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is itThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou elseIn the dark backward and abysm of time?If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,How thou camest here thou mayst.MIRANDABut that I do not.PROSPEROTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,Thy father was the Duke of Milan andA prince of power.MIRANDASir, are not you my father?PROSPEROThy mother was a piece of virtue, andShe said thou wast my daughter; and thy fatherWas Duke of Milan; and thou his only heirAnd princess no worse issued.MIRANDAO the heavens!What foul play had we, that we came from thence?Or blessed was't we did?PROSPEROBoth, both, my girl:By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,But blessedly holp hither.MIRANDAO, my heart bleedsTo think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.PROSPEROMy brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--I pray thee, mark me--that a brother shouldBe so perfidious!--he whom next thyselfOf all the world I loved and to him putThe manage of my state; as at that timeThrough all the signories it was the firstAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputedIn dignity, and for the liberal artsWithout a parallel; those being all my study,The government I cast upon my brotherAnd to my state grew stranger, being transportedAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--Dost thou attend me?MIRANDASir, most heedfully.PROSPEROBeing once perfected how to grant suits,How to deny them, who to advance and whoTo trash for over-topping, new createdThe creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,Or else new form'd 'em; having both the keyOf officer and office, set all hearts i' the stateTo what tune pleased his ear; that now he wasThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.MIRANDAO, good sir, I do.PROSPEROI pray thee, mark me.I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicatedTo closeness and the bettering of my mindWith that which, but by being so retired,O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brotherAwaked an evil nature; and my trust,Like a good parent, did beget of himA falsehood in its contrary as greatAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,Not only with what my revenue yielded,But what my power might else exact, like oneWho having into truth, by telling of it,Made such a sinner of his memory,To credit his own lie, he did believeHe was indeed the duke; out o' the substitutionAnd executing the outward face of royalty,With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--Dost thou hear?MIRANDAYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.PROSPEROTo have no screen between this part he play'dAnd him he play'd it for, he needs will beAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my libraryWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royaltiesHe thinks me now incapable; confederates--So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of NaplesTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,Subject his coronet to his crown and bendThe dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--To most ignoble stooping.MIRANDAO the heavens!PROSPEROMark his condition and the event; then tell meIf this might be a brother.MIRANDAI should sinTo think but nobly of my grandmother:Good wombs have borne bad sons.PROSPERONow the condition.The King of Naples, being an enemyTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premisesOf homage and I know not how much tribute,Should presently extirpate me and mineOut of the dukedom and confer fair MilanWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,A treacherous army levied, one midnightFated to the purpose did Antonio openThe gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,The ministers for the purpose hurried thenceMe and thy crying self.MIRANDAAlack, for pity!I, not remembering how I cried out then,Will cry it o'er again: it is a hintThat wrings mine eyes to't.PROSPEROHear a little furtherAnd then I'll bring thee to the present businessWhich now's upon's; without the which this storyWere most impertinent.MIRANDAWherefore did they notThat hour destroy us?PROSPEROWell demanded, wench:My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,So dear the love my people bore me, nor setA mark so bloody on the business, butWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,Bore us some leagues to sea; where they preparedA rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very ratsInstinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sighTo the winds whose pity, sighing back again,Did us but loving wrong.MIRANDAAlack, what troubleWas I then to you!PROSPEROO, a cherubimThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.Infused with a fortitude from heaven,When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in meAn undergoing stomach, to bear upAgainst what should ensue.MIRANDAHow came we ashore?PROSPEROBy Providence divine.Some food we had and some fresh water thatA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,Out of his charity, being then appointedMaster of this design, did give us, withRich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd meFrom mine own library with volumes thatI prize above my dukedom.MIRANDAWould I mightBut ever see that man!PROSPERONow I arise:Resumes his mantleSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.Here in this island we arrived; and hereHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profitThan other princesses can that have more timeFor vainer hours and tutors not so careful.MIRANDAHeavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reasonFor raising this sea-storm?PROSPEROKnow thus far forth.By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,Now my dear lady, hath mine enemiesBrought to this shore; and by my prescienceI find my zenith doth depend uponA most auspicious star, whose influenceIf now I court not but omit, my fortunesWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions:Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.MIRANDA sleepsCome away, servant, come. I am ready now.Approach, my Ariel, come.Enter ARIELARIELAll hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I comeTo answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,To swim, to dive into the fire, to rideOn the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding taskAriel and all his quality.PROSPEROHast thou, spirit,Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?ARIELTo every article.I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,And burn in many places; on the topmast,The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursorsO' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentaryAnd sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracksOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty NeptuneSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,Yea, his dread trident shake.PROSPEROMy brave spirit!Who was so firm, so constant, that this coilWould not infect his reason?ARIELNot a soulBut felt a fever of the mad and play'dSome tricks of desperation. All but marinersPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is emptyAnd all the devils are here.'PROSPEROWhy that's my spirit!But was not this nigh shore?ARIELClose by, my master.PROSPEROBut are they, Ariel, safe?ARIELNot a hair perish'd;On their sustaining garments not a blemish,But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.The king's son have I landed by himself;Whom I left cooling of the air with sighsIn an odd angle of the isle and sitting,His arms in this sad knot.PROSPEROOf the king's shipThe mariners say how thou hast disposedAnd all the rest o' the fleet.ARIELSafely in harbourIs the king's ship; in the deep nook, where onceThou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dewFrom the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:The mariners all under hatches stow'd;Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleetWhich I dispersed, they all have met againAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote,Bound sadly home for Naples,Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'dAnd his great person perish.PROSPEROAriel, thy chargeExactly is perform'd: but there's more work.What is the time o' the day?ARIELPast the mid season.PROSPEROAt least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and nowMust by us both be spent most preciously.ARIELIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,Which is not yet perform'd me.PROSPEROHow now? moody?What is't thou canst demand?ARIELMy liberty.PROSPEROBefore the time be out? no more!ARIELI prithee,Remember I have done thee worthy service;Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, servedWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promiseTo bate me a full year.PROSPERODost thou forgetFrom what a torment I did free thee?ARIELNo.PROSPEROThou dost, and think'st it much to tread the oozeOf the salt deep,To run upon the sharp wind of the north,To do me business in the veins o' the earthWhen it is baked with frost.ARIELI do not, sir.PROSPEROThou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgotThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envyWas grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?ARIELNo, sir.PROSPEROThou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.ARIELSir, in Argier.PROSPEROO, was she so? I mustOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terribleTo enter human hearing, from Argier,Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she didThey would not take her life. Is not this true?ARIELAy, sir.PROSPEROThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with childAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;And, for thou wast a spirit too delicateTo act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,By help of her more potent ministersAnd in her most unmitigable rage,Into a cloven pine; within which riftImprison'd thou didst painfully remainA dozen years; within which space she diedAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groansAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--Save for the son that she did litter here,A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd withA human shape.ARIELYes, Caliban her son.PROSPERODull thing, I say so; he, that CalibanWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know'stWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groansDid make wolves howl and penetrate the breastsOf ever angry bears: it was a tormentTo lay upon the damn'd, which SycoraxCould not again undo: it was mine art,When I arrived and heard thee, that made gapeThe pine and let thee out.ARIELI thank thee, master.PROSPEROIf thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oakAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails tillThou hast howl'd away twelve winters.ARIELPardon, master;I will be correspondent to commandAnd do my spiriting gently.PROSPERODo so, and after two daysI will discharge thee.ARIELThat's my noble master!What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?PROSPEROGo make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subjectTo no sight but thine and mine, invisibleTo every eyeball else. Go take this shapeAnd hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!Exit ARIELAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!MIRANDAThe strangeness of your story putHeaviness in me.PROSPEROShake it off. Come on;We'll visit Caliban my slave, who neverYields us kind answer.MIRANDA'Tis a villain, sir,I do not love to look on.PROSPEROBut, as 'tis,We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,Fetch in our wood and serves in officesThat profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!Thou earth, thou! speak.CALIBAN[Within] There's wood enough within.PROSPEROCome forth, I say! there's other business for thee:Come, thou tortoise! when?Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymphFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,Hark in thine ear.ARIELMy lord it shall be done.ExitPROSPEROThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himselfUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!Enter CALIBANCALIBANAs wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'dWith raven's feather from unwholesome fenDrop on you both! a south-west blow on yeAnd blister you all o'er!PROSPEROFor this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchinsShall, for that vast of night that they may work,All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'dAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stingingThan bees that made 'em.CALIBANI must eat my dinner.This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give meWater with berries in't, and teach me howTo name the bigger light, and how the less,That burn by day and night: and then I loved theeAnd show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:Cursed be I that did so! All the charmsOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!For I am all the subjects that you have,Which first was mine own king: and here you sty meIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from meThe rest o' the island.PROSPEROThou most lying slave,Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged theeIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violateThe honour of my child.CALIBANO ho, O ho! would't had been done!Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled elseThis isle with Calibans.PROSPEROAbhorred slave,Which any print of goodness wilt not take,Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hourOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble likeA thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposesWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,Though thou didst learn, had that in't whichgood naturesCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thouDeservedly confined into this rock,Who hadst deserved more than a prison.CALIBANYou taught me language; and my profit on'tIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid youFor learning me your language!PROSPEROHag-seed, hence!Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?If thou neglect'st or dost unwillinglyWhat I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roarThat beasts shall tremble at thy din.CALIBANNo, pray thee.AsideI must obey: his art is of such power,It would control my dam's god, Setebos,and make a vassal of him.PROSPEROSo, slave; hence!Exit CALIBANRe-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND followingARIEL'S song.Come unto these yellow sands,And then take hands:Courtsied when you have and kiss'dThe wild waves whist,Foot it featly here and there;And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.Hark, hark!Burthen [dispersedly, withinThe watch-dogs bark!Burthen Bow-wowHark, hark! I hearThe strain of strutting chanticleerCry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.FERDINANDWhere should this music be? i' the air or the earth?It sounds no more: and sure, it waits uponSome god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,Weeping again the king my father's wreck,This music crept by me upon the waters,Allaying both their fury and my passionWith its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.No, it begins again.ARIEL singsFull fathom five thy father lies;Of his bones are coral made;Those are pearls that were his eyes:Nothing of him that doth fadeBut doth suffer a sea-changeInto something rich and strange.Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knellBurthen Ding-dongHark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.FERDINANDThe ditty does remember my drown'd father.This is no mortal business, nor no soundThat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.PROSPEROThe fringed curtains of thine eye advanceAnd say what thou seest yond.MIRANDAWhat is't? a spirit?Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.PROSPERONo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such sensesAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seestWas in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'dWith grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call himA goodly person: he hath lost his fellowsAnd strays about to find 'em.MIRANDAI might call himA thing divine, for nothing naturalI ever saw so noble.PROSPERO[Aside] It goes on, I see,As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free theeWithin two days for this.FERDINANDMost sure, the goddessOn whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayerMay know if you remain upon this island;And that you will some good instruction giveHow I may bear me here: my prime request,Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!If you be maid or no?MIRANDANo wonder, sir;But certainly a maid.FERDINANDMy language! heavens!I am the best of them that speak this speech,Were I but where 'tis spoken.PROSPEROHow? the best?What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?FERDINANDA single thing, as I am now, that wondersTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheldThe king my father wreck'd.MIRANDAAlack, for mercy!FERDINANDYes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of MilanAnd his brave son being twain.PROSPERO[Aside]	The Duke of MilanAnd his more braver daughter could control thee,If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sightThey have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,I'll set thee free for this.To FERDINANDA word, good sir;I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.MIRANDAWhy speaks my father so ungently? ThisIs the third man that e'er I saw, the firstThat e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my fatherTo be inclined my way!FERDINANDO, if a virgin,And your affection not gone forth, I'll make youThe queen of Naples.PROSPEROSoft, sir! one word more.AsideThey are both in either's powers; but this swift businessI must uneasy make, lest too light winningMake the prize light.To FERDINANDOne word more; I charge theeThat thou attend me: thou dost here usurpThe name thou owest not; and hast put thyselfUpon this island as a spy, to win itFrom me, the lord on't.FERDINANDNo, as I am a man.MIRANDAThere's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:If the ill spirit have so fair a house,Good things will strive to dwell with't.PROSPEROFollow me.Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall beThe fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husksWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.FERDINANDNo;I will resist such entertainment tillMine enemy has more power.Draws, and is charmed from movingMIRANDAO dear father,Make not too rash a trial of him, forHe's gentle and not fearful.PROSPEROWhat? I say,My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscienceIs so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,For I can here disarm thee with this stickAnd make thy weapon drop.MIRANDABeseech you, father.PROSPEROHence! hang not on my garments.MIRANDASir, have pity;I'll be his surety.PROSPEROSilence! one word moreShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!An advocate for an imposter! hush!Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!To the most of men this is a CalibanAnd they to him are angels.MIRANDAMy affectionsAre then most humble; I have no ambitionTo see a goodlier man.PROSPEROCome on; obey:Thy nerves are in their infancy againAnd have no vigour in them.FERDINANDSo they are;My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,Might I but through my prison once a dayBehold this maid: all corners else o' the earthLet liberty make use of; space enoughHave I in such a prison.PROSPERO[Aside] It works.To FERDINANDCome on.Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!To FERDINANDFollow me.To ARIELHark what thou else shalt do me.MIRANDABe of comfort;My father's of a better nature, sir,Than he appears by speech: this is unwontedWhich now came from him.PROSPEROThou shalt be freeAs mountain winds: but then exactly doAll points of my command.ARIELTo the syllable.PROSPEROCome, follow.

Our hint of woeIs common; every day some sailor's wife,The masters of some merchant and the merchantHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,I mean our preservation, few in millionsCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weighOur sorrow with our comfort.ALONSOPrithee, peace.SEBASTIANHe receives comfort like cold porridge.ANTONIOThe visitor will not give him o'er so.SEBASTIANLook he's winding up the watch of his wit;by and by it will strike.GONZALOSir,--SEBASTIANOne: tell.GONZALOWhen every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,Comes to the entertainer--SEBASTIANA dollar.GONZALODolour comes to him, indeed: youhave spoken truer than you purposed.SEBASTIANYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.GONZALOTherefore, my lord,--ANTONIOFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!ALONSOI prithee, spare.GONZALOWell, I have done: but yet,--SEBASTIANHe will be talking.ANTONIOWhich, of he or Adrian, for a goodwager, first begins to crow?SEBASTIANThe old cock.ANTONIOThe cockerel.SEBASTIANDone.

How came that widow in?widow Dido!SEBASTIANWhat if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,how you take it!ADRIAN'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.GONZALOThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.ADRIANCarthage?GONZALOI assure you, Carthage.SEBASTIANHis word is more than the miraculous harp; he hathraised the wall and houses too.ANTONIOWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?SEBASTIANI think he will carry this island home in his pocketand give it his son for an apple.ANTONIOAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bringforth more islands.GONZALOAy.ANTONIOWhy, in good time.GONZALOSir, we were talking that our garments seem nowas fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriageof your daughter, who is now queen.ANTONIOAnd the rarest that e'er came there.SEBASTIANBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.ANTONIOO, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.GONZALOIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day Iwore it? I mean, in a sort.ANTONIOThat sort was well fished for.GONZALOWhen I wore it at your daughter's marriage?ALONSOYou cram these words into mine ears againstThe stomach of my sense. Would I had neverMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,Who is so far from Italy removedI ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heirOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fishHath made his meal on thee?FRANCISCOSir, he may live:I saw him beat the surges under him,And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,Whose enmity he flung aside, and breastedThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'dHimself with his good arms in lusty strokeTo the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,As stooping to relieve him: I not doubtHe came alive to land.ALONSONo, no, he's gone.SEBASTIANSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,But rather lose her to an African;Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.ALONSOPrithee, peace.SEBASTIANYou were kneel'd to and importuned otherwiseBy all of us, and the fair soul herselfWeigh'd between loathness and obedience, atWhich end o' the beam should bow. We have lost yourson,I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples haveMore widows in them of this business' makingThan we bring men to comfort them:The fault's your own.ALONSOSo is the dear'st o' the loss.GONZALOMy lord Sebastian,The truth you speak doth lack some gentlenessAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,When you should bring the plaster.SEBASTIANVery well.ANTONIOAnd most chirurgeonly.GONZALOIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,When you are cloudy.SEBASTIANFoul weather?ANTONIOVery foul.GONZALOHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,--ANTONIOHe'ld sow't with nettle-seed.SEBASTIANOr docks, or mallows.GONZALOAnd were the king on't, what would I do?SEBASTIAN'Scape being drunk for want of wine.GONZALOI' the commonwealth I would by contrariesExecute all things; for no kind of trafficWould I admit; no name of magistrate;Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,And use of service, none; contract, succession,Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;No occupation; all men idle, all;And women too, but innocent and pure;No sovereignty;--SEBASTIANYet he would be king on't.ANTONIOThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets thebeginning.GONZALOAll things in common nature should produceWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,To feed my innocent people.SEBASTIANNo marrying 'mong his subjects?ANTONIONone, man; all idle: whores and knaves.GONZALOI would with such perfection govern, sir,To excel the golden age.SEBASTIANGod save his majesty!ANTONIOLong live Gonzalo!GONZALOAnd,--do you mark me, sir?ALONSOPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.GONZALOI do well believe your highness; anddid it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,who are of such sensible and nimble lungs thatthey always use to laugh at nothing.ANTONIO'Twas you we laughed at.GONZALOWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothingto you: so you may continue and laugh atnothing still.ANTONIOWhat a blow was there given!SEBASTIANAn it had not fallen flat-long.GONZALOYou are gentlemen of brave metal; you would liftthe moon out of her sphere, if she would continuein it five weeks without changing.Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn musicSEBASTIANWe would so, and then go a bat-fowling.ANTONIONay, good my lord, be not angry.GONZALONo, I warrant you; I will not adventuremy discretion so weakly.

I wish mine eyesWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I findThey are inclined to do so.SEBASTIANPlease you, sir,Do not omit the heavy offer of it:It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,It is a comforter.ANTONIOWe two, my lord,Will guard your person while you take your rest,And watch your safety.ALONSOThank you. Wondrous heavy.ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIELSEBASTIANWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!ANTONIOIt is the quality o' the climate.SEBASTIANWhyDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find notMyself disposed to sleep.ANTONIONor I; my spirits are nimble.They fell together all, as by consent;They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, andMy strong imagination sees a crownDropping upon thy head.SEBASTIANWhat, art thou waking?ANTONIODo you not hear me speak?SEBASTIANI do; and surelyIt is a sleepy language and thou speak'stOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?This is a strange repose, to be asleepWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,And yet so fast asleep.ANTONIONoble Sebastian,Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'stWhiles thou art waking.SEBASTIANThou dost snore distinctly;There's meaning in thy snores.ANTONIOI am more serious than my custom: youMust be so too, if heed me; which to doTrebles thee o'er.SEBASTIANWell, I am standing water.ANTONIOI'll teach you how to flow.SEBASTIANDo so: to ebbHereditary sloth instructs me.ANTONIOO,If you but knew how you the purpose cherishWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,Most often do so near the bottom runBy their own fear or sloth.SEBASTIANPrithee, say on:The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaimA matter from thee, and a birth indeedWhich throes thee much to yield.ANTONIOThus, sir:Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,Who shall be of as little memoryWhen he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--For he's a spirit of persuasion, onlyProfesses to persuade,--the king his son's alive,'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'dAnd he that sleeps here swims.SEBASTIANI have no hopeThat he's undrown'd.ANTONIOO, out of that 'no hope'What great hope have you! no hope that way isAnother way so high a hope that evenAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with meThat Ferdinand is drown'd?SEBASTIANHe's gone.ANTONIOThen, tell me,Who's the next heir of Naples?SEBASTIANClaribel.ANTONIOShe that is queen of Tunis; she that dwellsTen leagues beyond man's life; she that from NaplesCan have no note, unless the sun were post--The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chinsBe rough and razorable; she that--from whom?We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,And by that destiny to perform an actWhereof what's past is prologue, what to comeIn yours and my discharge.SEBASTIANWhat stuff is this! how say you?'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regionsThere is some space.ANTONIOA space whose every cubitSeems to cry out, 'How shall that ClaribelMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were deathThat now hath seized them; why, they were no worseThan now they are. There be that can rule NaplesAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prateAs amply and unnecessarilyAs this Gonzalo; I myself could makeA chough of as deep chat. O, that you boreThe mind that I do! what a sleep were thisFor your advancement! Do you understand me?SEBASTIANMethinks I do.ANTONIOAnd how does your contentTender your own good fortune?SEBASTIANI rememberYou did supplant your brother Prospero.ANTONIOTrue:And look how well my garments sit upon me;Much feater than before: my brother's servantsWere then my fellows; now they are my men.SEBASTIANBut, for your conscience?ANTONIOAy, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel notThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be theyAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,No better than the earth he lies upon,If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,To the perpetual wink for aye might putThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, whoShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;They'll tell the clock to any business thatWe say befits the hour.SEBASTIANThy case, dear friend,Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one strokeShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;And I the king shall love thee.ANTONIODraw together;And when I rear my hand, do you the like,To fall it on Gonzalo.SEBASTIANO, but one word.They talk apartRe-enter ARIEL, invisibleARIELMy master through his art foresees the dangerThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--For else his project dies--to keep them living.Sings in GONZALO's earWhile you here do snoring lie,Open-eyed conspiracyHis time doth take.If of life you keep a care,Shake off slumber, and beware:Awake, awake!ANTONIOThen let us both be sudden.GONZALONow, good angelsPreserve the king.They wakeALONSOWhy, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?Wherefore this ghastly looking?GONZALOWhat's the matter?SEBASTIANWhiles we stood here securing your repose,Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowingLike bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?It struck mine ear most terribly.ALONSOI heard nothing.ANTONIOO, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roarOf a whole herd of lions.ALONSOHeard you this, Gonzalo?GONZALOUpon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,And that a strange one too, which did awake me:I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.ALONSOLead off this ground; and let's make further searchFor my poor son.GONZALOHeavens keep him from these beasts!For he is, sure, i' the island.ALONSOLead away.ARIELProspero my lord shall know what I have done:So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.ExeuntSCENE II. Another part of the island.Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heardCALIBANAll the infections that the sun sucks upFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make himBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear meAnd yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the darkOut of my way, unless he bid 'em; butFor every trifle are they set upon me;Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at meAnd after bite me, then like hedgehogs whichLie tumbling in my barefoot way and mountTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am IAll wound with adders who with cloven tonguesDo hiss me into madness.Enter TRINCULOLo, now, lo!Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment meFor bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;Perchance he will not mind me.TRINCULOHere's neither bush nor shrub, to bear offany weather at all, and another storm brewing;I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same blackcloud, yond huge one, looks like a foulbombard that would shed his liquor. If itshould thunder as it did before, I know notwhere to hide my head: yond same cloud cannotchoose but fall by pailfuls. What have wehere? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,as once I was, and had but this fish painted,not a holiday fool there but would give a pieceof silver: there would this monster make aman; any strange beast there makes a man:when they will not give a doit to relieve a lamebeggar, they will lazy out ten to see a deadIndian. Legged like a man and his fins likearms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loosemy opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,but an islander, that hath lately suffered by athunderbolt.ThunderAlas, the storm is come again! my best way is tocreep under his gaberdine; there is no othershelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man withstrange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till thedregs of the storm be past.Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his handSTEPHANOI shall no more to sea, to sea,Here shall I die ashore--This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man'sfuneral: well, here's my comfort.DrinksSingsThe master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,The gunner and his mateLoved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,But none of us cared for Kate;For she had a tongue with a tang,Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.DrinksCALIBANDo not torment me: Oh!STEPHANOWhat's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you puttricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? Ihave not scaped drowning to be afeard now of yourfour legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man asever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;and it shall be said so again while Stephanobreathes at's nostrils.CALIBANThe spirit torments me; Oh!STEPHANOThis is some monster of the isle with four legs, whohath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devilshould he learn our language? I will give him somerelief, if it be but for that. if I can recover himand keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's apresent for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.CALIBANDo not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.STEPHANOHe's in his fit now and does not talk after thewisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he havenever drunk wine afore will go near to remove hisfit.

Thou art very Trinculo indeed! Howcamest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? canhe vent Trinculos?TRINCULOI took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. Butart thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou artnot drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid meunder the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear ofthe storm. And art thou living, Stephano? OStephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!STEPHANOPrithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.CALIBAN[Aside] These be fine things, an if they benot sprites.That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.I will kneel to him.STEPHANOHow didst thou 'scape?

Mercy upon us!CALIBANArt thou afeard?STEPHANONo, monster, not I.CALIBANBe not afeard; the isle is full of noises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.Sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentsWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voicesThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,The clouds methought would open and show richesReady to drop upon me that, when I waked,I cried to dream again.STEPHANOThis will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shallhave my music for nothing.CALIBANWhen Prospero is destroyed.STEPHANOThat shall be by and by: I remember the story.TRINCULOThe sound is going away; let's follow it, andafter do our work.STEPHANOLead, monster; we'll follow.

Well, let him go.ANTONIO[Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's soout of hope.Do not, for one repulse, forego the purposeThat you resolved to effect.SEBASTIAN[Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantageWill we take throughly.ANTONIO[Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;For, now they are oppress'd with travel, theyWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilanceAs when they are fresh.SEBASTIAN[Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.Solemn and strange musicALONSOWhat harmony is this?

Thee of thy son, Alonso,They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:Lingering perdition, worse than any deathCan be at once, shall step by step attendYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--Which here, in this most desolate isle, else fallsUpon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrowAnd a clear life ensuing.He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the tablePROSPEROBravely the figure of this harpy hast thouPerform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:Of my instruction hast thou nothing batedIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good lifeAnd observation strange, my meaner ministersTheir several kinds have done.

Say, my spirit,How fares the king and's followers?ARIELConfined togetherIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;They cannot budge till your release. The king,His brother and yours, abide all three distractedAnd the remainder mourning over them,Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chieflyHim that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'His tears run down his beard, like winter's dropsFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'emThat if you now beheld them, your affectionsWould become tender.PROSPERODost thou think so, spirit?ARIELMine would, sir, were I human.PROSPEROAnd mine shall.Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feelingOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my furyDo I take part: the rarer action isIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,The sole drift of my purpose doth extendNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,And they shall be themselves.ARIELI'll fetch them, sir.ExitPROSPEROYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,And ye that on the sands with printless footDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly himWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets thatBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastimeIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoiceTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'dThe noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vaultSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunderHave I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oakWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontoryHave I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd upThe pine and cedar: graves at my commandHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forthBy my so potent art. But this rough magicI here abjure, and, when I have requiredSome heavenly music, which even now I do,To work mine end upon their senses thatThis airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,And deeper than did ever plummet soundI'll drown my book.Solemn musicRe-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:A solemn air and the best comforterTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,For you are spell-stopp'd.Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,And as the morning steals upon the night,Melting the darkness, so their rising sensesBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantleTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,My true preserver, and a loyal sirTo him you follow'st! I will pay thy gracesHome both in word and deed. Most cruellyDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,Unnatural though thou art. Their understandingBegins to swell, and the approaching tideWill shortly fill the reasonable shoreThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of themThat yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:I will discase me, and myself presentAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;Thou shalt ere long be free.ARIEL sings and helps to attire himWhere the bee sucks. there suck I:In a cowslip's bell I lie;There I couch when owls do cry.On the bat's back I do flyAfter summer merrily.Merrily, merrily shall I live nowUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.PROSPEROWhy, that's my dainty Ariel!

When did you lose your daughter?PROSPEROIn this last tempest. I perceive these lordsAt this encounter do so much admireThat they devour their reason and scarce thinkTheir eyes do offices of truth, their wordsAre natural breath: but, howsoe'er you haveBeen justled from your senses, know for certainThat I am Prospero and that very dukeWhich was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangelyUpon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,To be the lord on't.

Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUSARCHIDAMUSIf you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, onthe like occasion whereon my services are now onfoot, you shall see, as I have said, greatdifference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.CAMILLOI think, this coming summer, the King of Siciliameans to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.ARCHIDAMUSWherein our entertainment shall shame us we will bejustified in our loves; for indeed--CAMILLOBeseech you,--ARCHIDAMUSVerily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I knownot what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuseus.CAMILLOYou pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.ARCHIDAMUSBelieve me, I speak as my understanding instructs meand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.CAMILLOSicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.They were trained together in their childhoods; andthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,which cannot choose but branch now. Since theirmore mature dignities and royal necessities madeseparation of their society, their encounters,though not personal, have been royally attorneyedwith interchange of gifts, letters, lovingembassies; that they have seemed to be together,though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, andembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposedwinds. The heavens continue their loves!ARCHIDAMUSI think there is not in the world either malice ormatter to alter it. You have an unspeakablecomfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is agentleman of the greatest promise that ever cameinto my note.CAMILLOI very well agree with you in the hopes of him: itis a gallant child; one that indeed physics thesubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went oncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life tosee him a man.ARCHIDAMUSWould they else be content to die?CAMILLOYes; if there were no other excuse why they shoulddesire to live.ARCHIDAMUSIf the king had no son, they would desire to liveon crutches till he had one.ExeuntSCENE II. A room of state in the same.Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and AttendantsPOLIXENESNine changes of the watery star hath beenThe shepherd's note since we have left our throneWithout a burthen: time as long againWould be find up, my brother, with our thanks;And yet we should, for perpetuity,Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,Yet standing in rich place, I multiplyWith one 'We thank you' many thousands moeThat go before it.LEONTESStay your thanks a while;And pay them when you part.POLIXENESSir, that's to-morrow.I am question'd by my fears, of what may chanceOr breed upon our absence; that may blowNo sneaping winds at home, to make us say'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'dTo tire your royalty.LEONTESWe are tougher, brother,Than you can put us to't.POLIXENESNo longer stay.LEONTESOne seven-night longer.POLIXENESVery sooth, to-morrow.LEONTESWe'll part the time between's then; and in thatI'll no gainsaying.POLIXENESPress me not, beseech you, so.There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,Were there necessity in your request, although'Twere needful I denied it. My affairsDo even drag me homeward: which to hinderWere in your love a whip to me; my stayTo you a charge and trouble: to save both,Farewell, our brother.LEONTESTongue-tied, our queen?speak you.HERMIONEI had thought, sir, to have held my peace untilYou have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sureAll in Bohemia's well; this satisfactionThe by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,He's beat from his best ward.LEONTESWell said, Hermione.HERMIONETo tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:But let him say so then, and let him go;But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.Yet of your royal presence I'll adventureThe borrow of a week. When at BohemiaYou take my lord, I'll give him my commissionTo let him there a month behind the gestPrefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,I love thee not a jar o' the clock behindWhat lady-she her lord. You'll stay?POLIXENESNo, madam.HERMIONENay, but you will?POLIXENESI may not, verily.HERMIONEVerily!You put me off with limber vows; but I,Though you would seek to unsphere thestars with oaths,Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 'sAs potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?Force me to keep you as a prisoner,Not like a guest; so you shall pay your feesWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'One of them you shall be.POLIXENESYour guest, then, madam:To be your prisoner should import offending;Which is for me less easy to commitThan you to punish.HERMIONENot your gaoler, then,But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question youOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:You were pretty lordings then?POLIXENESWe were, fair queen,Two lads that thought there was no more behindBut such a day to-morrow as to-day,And to be boy eternal.HERMIONEWas not my lordThe verier wag o' the two?POLIXENESWe were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,And bleat the one at the other: what we changedWas innocence for innocence; we knew notThe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'dThat any did. Had we pursued that life,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'dWith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heavenBoldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'dHereditary ours.HERMIONEBy this we gatherYou have tripp'd since.POLIXENESO my most sacred lady!Temptations have since then been born to's; forIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl;Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyesOf my young play-fellow.HERMIONEGrace to boot!Of this make no conclusion, lest you sayYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;The offences we have made you do we'll answer,If you first sinn'd with us and that with usYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd notWith any but with us.LEONTESIs he won yet?HERMIONEHe'll stay my lord.LEONTESAt my request he would not.Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokestTo better purpose.HERMIONENever?LEONTESNever, but once.HERMIONEWhat! have I twice said well? when was't before?I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make'sAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tonguelessSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.Our praises are our wages: you may ride'sWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ereWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:My last good deed was to entreat his stay:What was my first? it has an elder sister,Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?Nay, let me have't; I long.LEONTESWhy, that was whenThree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,Ere I could make thee open thy white handAnd clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter'I am yours for ever.'HERMIONE'Tis grace indeed.Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;The other for some while a friend.LEONTES[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;But not for joy; not joy. This entertainmentMay a free face put on, derive a libertyFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,As now they are, and making practised smiles,As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twereThe mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainmentMy bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,Art thou my boy?MAMILLIUSAy, my good lord.LEONTESI' fecks!Why, that's my bawcock. What, hastsmutch'd thy nose?They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:And yet the steer, the heifer and the calfAre all call'd neat.--Still virginallingUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!Art thou my calf?MAMILLIUSYes, if you will, my lord.LEONTESThou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,To be full like me: yet they say we areAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,That will say anything but were they falseAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, falseAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixesNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it trueTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:Thou dost make possible things not so held,Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--With what's unreal thou coactive art,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credentThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,And that beyond commission, and I find it,And that to the infection of my brainsAnd hardening of my brows.POLIXENESWhat means Sicilia?HERMIONEHe something seems unsettled.POLIXENESHow, my lord!What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?HERMIONEYou look as if you held a brow of much distractionAre you moved, my lord?LEONTESNo, in good earnest.How sometimes nature will betray its folly,Its tenderness, and make itself a pastimeTo harder bosoms! Looking on the linesOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoilTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,Will you take eggs for money?MAMILLIUSNo, my lord, I'll fight.LEONTESYou will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,Are you so fond of your young prince as weDo seem to be of ours?POLIXENESIf at home, sir,He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:He makes a July's day short as December,And with his varying childness cures in meThoughts that would thick my blood.LEONTESSo stands this squireOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:Next to thyself and my young rover, he'sApparent to my heart.HERMIONEIf you would seek us,We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?LEONTESTo your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,Be you beneath the sky.AsideI am angling now,Though you perceive me not how I give line.Go to, go to!How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!And arms her with the boldness of a wifeTo her allowing husband!Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and AttendantsGone already!Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head andears a fork'd one!Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and IPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issueWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamourWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.There have been,Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;And many a man there is, even at this present,Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absenceAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, bySir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in'tWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,As mine, against their will. Should all despairThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankindWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;It is a bawdy planet, that will strikeWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,No barricado for a belly; know't;It will let in and out the enemyWith bag and baggage: many thousand on'sHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!MAMILLIUSI am like you, they say.LEONTESWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?CAMILLOAy, my good lord.LEONTESGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.Exit MAMILLIUSCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.CAMILLOYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:When you cast out, it still came home.LEONTESDidst note it?CAMILLOHe would not stay at your petitions: madeHis business more material.LEONTESDidst perceive it?AsideThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,That he did stay?CAMILLOAt the good queen's entreaty.LEONTESAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinentBut, so it is, it is not. Was this takenBy any understanding pate but thine?For thy conceit is soaking, will draw inMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,But of the finer natures? by some severalsOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messesPerchance are to this business purblind? say.CAMILLOBusiness, my lord! I think most understandBohemia stays here longer.LEONTESHa!CAMILLOStays here longer.LEONTESAy, but why?CAMILLOTo satisfy your highness and the entreatiesOf our most gracious mistress.LEONTESSatisfy!The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,With all the nearest things to my heart, as wellMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thouHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departedThy penitent reform'd: but we have beenDeceived in thy integrity, deceivedIn that which seems so.CAMILLOBe it forbid, my lord!LEONTESTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,Which hoxes honesty behind, restrainingFrom course required; or else thou must be countedA servant grafted in my serious trustAnd therein negligent; or else a foolThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,And takest it all for jest.CAMILLOMy gracious lord,I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;In every one of these no man is free,But that his negligence, his folly, fear,Among the infinite doings of the world,Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,If ever I were wilful-negligent,It was my folly; if industriouslyI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,Not weighing well the end; if ever fearfulTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,Where of the execution did cry outAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fearWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,Are such allow'd infirmities that honestyIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,Be plainer with me; let me know my trespassBy its own visage: if I then deny it,'Tis none of mine.LEONTESHa' not you seen, Camillo,--But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glassIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--For to a vision so apparent rumourCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitationResides not in that man that does not think,--My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,Or else be impudently negative,To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then sayMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a nameAs rank as any flax-wench that puts toBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.CAMILLOI would not be a stander-by to hearMy sovereign mistress clouded so, withoutMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,You never spoke what did become you lessThan this; which to reiterate were sinAs deep as that, though true.LEONTESIs whispering nothing?Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?Kissing with inside lip? stopping the careerOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallibleOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyesBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,If this be nothing.CAMILLOGood my lord, be curedOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;For 'tis most dangerous.LEONTESSay it be, 'tis true.CAMILLONo, no, my lord.LEONTESIt is; you lie, you lie:I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,Or else a hovering temporizer, thatCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,Inclining to them both: were my wife's liverInfected as her life, she would not liveThe running of one glass.CAMILLOWho does infect her?LEONTESWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hangingAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if IHad servants true about me, that bare eyesTo see alike mine honour as their profits,Their own particular thrifts, they would do thatWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner formHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst seePlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,To give mine enemy a lasting wink;Which draught to me were cordial.CAMILLOSir, my lord,I could do this, and that with no rash potion,But with a lingering dram that should not workMaliciously like poison: but I cannotBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,So sovereignly being honourable.I have loved thee,--LEONTESMake that thy question, and go rot!Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,To appoint myself in this vexation, sullyThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,Which to preserve is sleep, which being spottedIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,Who I do think is mine and love as mine,Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?Could man so blench?CAMILLOI must believe you, sir:I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;Provided that, when he's removed, your highnessWill take again your queen as yours at first,Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealingThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdomsKnown and allied to yours.LEONTESThou dost advise meEven so as I mine own course have set down:I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.CAMILLOMy lord,Go then; and with a countenance as clearAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with BohemiaAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:If from me he have wholesome beverage,Account me not your servant.LEONTESThis is all:Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;Do't not, thou split'st thine own.CAMILLOI'll do't, my lord.LEONTESI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.ExitCAMILLOO miserable lady! But, for me,What case stand I in? I must be the poisonerOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do'tIs the obedience to a master, oneWho in rebellion with himself will haveAll that are his so too. To do this deed,Promotion follows. If I could find exampleOf thousands that had struck anointed kingsAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but sinceNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,Let villany itself forswear't. I mustForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certainTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!Here comes Bohemia.Re-enter POLIXENESPOLIXENESThis is strange: methinksMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?Good day, Camillo.CAMILLOHail, most royal sir!POLIXENESWhat is the news i' the court?CAMILLONone rare, my lord.POLIXENESThe king hath on him such a countenanceAs he had lost some province and a regionLoved as he loves himself: even now I met himWith customary compliment; when he,Wafting his eyes to the contrary and fallingA lip of much contempt, speeds from me andSo leaves me to consider what is breedingThat changeth thus his manners.CAMILLOI dare not know, my lord.POLIXENESHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,Your changed complexions are to me a mirrorWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must beA party in this alteration, findingMyself thus alter'd with 't.CAMILLOThere is a sicknessWhich puts some of us in distemper, butI cannot name the disease; and it is caughtOf you that yet are well.POLIXENESHow! caught of me!Make me not sighted like the basilisk:I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the betterBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--As you are certainly a gentleman, theretoClerk-like experienced, which no less adornsOur gentry than our parents' noble names,In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,If you know aught which does behove my knowledgeThereof to be inform'd, imprison't notIn ignorant concealment.CAMILLOI may not answer.POLIXENESA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,I conjure thee, by all the parts of manWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the leastIs not this suit of mine, that thou declareWhat incidency thou dost guess of harmIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;Which way to be prevented, if to be;If not, how best to bear it.CAMILLOSir, I will tell you;Since I am charged in honour and by himThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,Which must be even as swiftly follow'd asI mean to utter it, or both yourself and meCry lost, and so good night!POLIXENESOn, good Camillo.CAMILLOI am appointed him to murder you.POLIXENESBy whom, Camillo?CAMILLOBy the king.POLIXENESFor what?CAMILLOHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,As he had seen't or been an instrumentTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queenForbiddenly.POLIXENESO, then my best blood turnTo an infected jelly and my nameBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!Turn then my freshest reputation toA savour that may strike the dullest nostrilWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infectionThat e'er was heard or read!CAMILLOSwear his thought overBy each particular star in heaven andBy all their influences, you may as wellForbid the sea for to obey the moonAs or by oath remove or counsel shakeThe fabric of his folly, whose foundationIs piled upon his faith and will continueThe standing of his body.POLIXENESHow should this grow?CAMILLOI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer toAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.If therefore you dare trust my honesty,That lies enclosed in this trunk which youShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!Your followers I will whisper to the business,And will by twos and threes at several posternsClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll putMy fortunes to your service, which are hereBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;For, by the honour of my parents, IHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,I dare not stand by; nor shall you be saferThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereonHis execution sworn.POLIXENESI do believe thee:I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:Be pilot to me and thy places shallStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready andMy people did expect my hence departureTwo days ago. This jealousyIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,Must it be violent, and as he does conceiveHe is dishonour'd by a man which everProfess'd to him, why, his revenges mustIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:Good expedition be my friend, and comfortThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothingOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;I will respect thee as a father ifThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.CAMILLOIt is in mine authority to commandThe keys of all the posterns: please your highnessTo take the urgent hour.

I love you better.Second LadyAnd why so, my lord?MAMILLIUSNot for becauseYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,Become some women best, so that there be notToo much hair there, but in a semicircleOr a half-moon made with a pen.Second LadyWho taught you this?MAMILLIUSI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray nowWhat colour are your eyebrows?First LadyBlue, my lord.MAMILLIUSNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's noseThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.First LadyHark ye;The queen your mother rounds apace: we shallPresent our services to a fine new princeOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,If we would have you.Second LadyShe is spread of lateInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!HERMIONEWhat wisdom stirs amongst you?

Gentle my lord,You scarce can right me throughly then to sayYou did mistake.LEONTESNo; if I mistakeIn those foundations which I build upon,The centre is not big enough to bearA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!He who shall speak for her is afar off guiltyBut that he speaks.HERMIONEThere's some ill planet reigns:I must be patient till the heavens lookWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,I am not prone to weeping, as our sexCommonly are; the want of which vain dewPerchance shall dry your pities: but I haveThat honourable grief lodged here which burnsWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,With thoughts so qualified as your charitiesShall best instruct you, measure me; and soThe king's will be perform'd!LEONTESShall I be heard?HERMIONEWho is't that goes with me?

Our prerogativeCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodnessImparts this; which if you, or stupefiedOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will notRelish a truth like us, inform yourselvesWe need no more of your advice: the matter,The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is allProperly ours.ANTIGONUSAnd I wish, my liege,You had only in your silent judgment tried it,Without more overture.LEONTESHow could that be?Either thou art most ignorant by age,Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,Added to their familiarity,Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,That lack'd sight only, nought for approbationBut only seeing, all other circumstancesMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:Yet, for a greater confirmation,For in an act of this importance 'twereMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in postTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,Cleomenes and Dion, whom you knowOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracleThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?First LordWell done, my lord.LEONTESThough I am satisfied and need no moreThan what I know, yet shall the oracleGive rest to the minds of others, such as heWhose ignorant credulity will notCome up to the truth. So have we thought it goodFrom our free person she should be confined,Lest that the treachery of the two fled henceBe left her to perform.

Hence with her, out o' door:A most intelligencing bawd!PAULINANot so:I am as ignorant in that as youIn so entitling me, and no less honestThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,As this world goes, to pass for honest.LEONTESTraitors!Will you not push her out?

I'll not call you tyrant;But this most cruel usage of your queen,Not able to produce more accusationThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savoursOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,Yea, scandalous to the world.LEONTESOn your allegiance,Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,Where were her life? she durst not call me so,If she did know me one. Away with her!PAULINAI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:Jove send herA better guiding spirit!

If thou refuseAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;The bastard brains with these my proper handsShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;For thou set'st on thy wife.ANTIGONUSI did not, sir:These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,Can clear me in't.LordsWe can: my royal liege,He is not guilty of her coming hither.LEONTESYou're liars all.First LordBeseech your highness, give us better credit:We have always truly served you, and beseech youSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,As recompense of our dear servicesPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,Which being so horrible, so bloody, mustLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.LEONTESI am a feather for each wind that blows:Shall I live on to see this bastard kneelAnd call me father? better burn it nowThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;You that have been so tenderly officiousWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,So sure as this beard's grey,--what will you adventureTo save this brat's life?ANTIGONUSAny thing, my lord,That my ability may undergoAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:I'll pawn the little blood which I have leftTo save the innocent: any thing possible.LEONTESIt shall be possible. Swear by this swordThou wilt perform my bidding.ANTIGONUSI will, my lord.LEONTESMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the failOf any point in't shall not only beDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carryThis female bastard hence and that thou bear itTo some remote and desert place quite outOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,Without more mercy, to its own protectionAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortuneIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,That thou commend it strangely to some placeWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.ANTIGONUSI swear to do this, though a present deathHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravensTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they sayCasting their savageness aside have doneLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperousIn more than this deed does require! And blessingAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!Exit with the childLEONTESNo, I'll not rearAnother's issue.Enter a ServantServantPlease your highness, postsFrom those you sent to the oracle are comeAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,Hasting to the court.First LordSo please you, sir, their speedHath been beyond account.LEONTESTwenty-three daysThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretellsThe great Apollo suddenly will haveThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;Summon a session, that we may arraignOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hathBeen publicly accused, so shall she haveA just and open trial.

A sea-port in Sicilia.Enter CLEOMENES and DIONCLEOMENESThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassingThe common praise it bears.DIONI shall report,For most it caught me, the celestial habits,Methinks I so should term them, and the reverenceOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!How ceremonious, solemn and unearthlyIt was i' the offering!CLEOMENESBut of all, the burstAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.That I was nothing.DIONIf the event o' the journeyProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,The time is worth the use on't.CLEOMENESGreat ApolloTurn all to the best! These proclamations,So forcing faults upon Hermione,I little like.DIONThe violent carriage of itWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,Shall the contents discover, something rareEven then will rush to knowledge.

A court of Justice.Enter LEONTES, Lords, and OfficersLEONTESThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party triedThe daughter of a king, our wife, and oneOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'dOf being tyrannous, since we so openlyProceed in justice, which shall have due course,Even to the guilt or the purgation.Produce the prisoner.OfficerIt is his highness' pleasure that the queenAppear in person here in court. Silence!Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attendingLEONTESRead the indictment.Officer[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthyLeontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused andarraigned of high treason, in committing adulterywith Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiringwith Camillo to take away the life of our sovereignlord the king, thy royal husband: the pretencewhereof being by circumstances partly laid open,thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegianceof a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, fortheir better safety, to fly away by night.HERMIONESince what I am to say must be but thatWhich contradicts my accusation andThe testimony on my part no otherBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot meTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrityBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,Be so received. But thus: if powers divineBehold our human actions, as they do,I doubt not then but innocence shall makeFalse accusation blush and tyrannyTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,Who least will seem to do so, my past lifeHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,As I am now unhappy; which is moreThan history can pattern, though devisedAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold meA fellow of the royal bed, which oweA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,The mother to a hopeful prince, here standingTo prate and talk for life and honour 'foreWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize itAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,'Tis a derivative from me to mine,And only that I stand for. I appealTo your own conscience, sir, before PolixenesCame to your court, how I was in your grace,How merited to be so; since he came,With what encounter so uncurrent IHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyondThe bound of honour, or in act or willThat way inclining, harden'd be the heartsOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kinCry fie upon my grave!LEONTESI ne'er heard yetThat any of these bolder vices wantedLess impudence to gainsay what they didThan to perform it first.HERMIONEThat's true enough;Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.LEONTESYou will not own it.HERMIONEMore than mistress ofWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must notAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,With whom I am accused, I do confessI loved him as in honour he required,With such a kind of love as might becomeA lady like me, with a love even such,So and no other, as yourself commanded:Which not to have done I think had been in meBoth disobedience and ingratitudeTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,Even since it could speak, from an infant, freelyThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'dFor me to try how: all I know of itIs that Camillo was an honest man;And why he left your court, the gods themselves,Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.LEONTESYou knew of his departure, as you knowWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.HERMIONESir,You speak a language that I understand not:My life stands in the level of your dreams,Which I'll lay down.LEONTESYour actions are my dreams;You had a bastard by Polixenes,And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:Which to deny concerns more than avails; for asThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,No father owning it,--which is, indeed,More criminal in thee than it,--so thouShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passageLook for no less than death.HERMIONESir, spare your threats:The bug which you would fright me with I seek.To me can life be no commodity:The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,But know not how it went. My second joyAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presenceI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfortStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,Haled out to murder: myself on every postProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatredThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longsTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurriedHere to this place, i' the open air, beforeI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,Tell me what blessings I have here alive,That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'dUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping elseBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,I do refer me to the oracle:Apollo be my judge!First LordThis your requestIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,And in Apollos name, his oracle.Exeunt certain OfficersHERMIONEThe Emperor of Russia was my father:O that he were alive, and here beholdingHis daughter's trial! that he did but seeThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyesOf pity, not revenge!Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DIONOfficerYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,That you, Cleomenes and Dion, haveBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have broughtThe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'dOf great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,You have not dared to break the holy sealNor read the secrets in't.CLEOMENES DIONAll this we swear.LEONTESBreak up the seals and read.Officer[Reads]	Hermione is chaste;Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontesa jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;and the king shall live without an heir, if thatwhich is lost be not found.LordsNow blessed be the great Apollo!HERMIONEPraised!LEONTESHast thou read truth?OfficerAy, my lord; even soAs it is here set down.LEONTESThere is no truth at all i' the oracle:The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.Enter ServantServantMy lord the king, the king!LEONTESWhat is the business?ServantO sir, I shall be hated to report it!The prince your son, with mere conceit and fearOf the queen's speed, is gone.LEONTESHow! gone!ServantIs dead.LEONTESApollo's angry; and the heavens themselvesDo strike at my injustice.HERMIONE swoonsHow now there!PAULINAThis news is mortal to the queen: look downAnd see what death is doing.LEONTESTake her hence:Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:I have too much believed mine own suspicion:Beseech you, tenderly apply to herSome remedies for life.Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONEApollo, pardonMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;For, being transported by my jealousiesTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I choseCamillo for the minister to poisonMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,But that the good mind of Camillo tardiedMy swift command, though I with death and withReward did threaten and encourage him,Not doing 't and being done: he, most humaneAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guestUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,Which you knew great, and to the hazardOf all encertainties himself commended,No richer than his honour: how he glistersThorough my rust! and how his pityDoes my deeds make the blacker!Re-enter PAULINAPAULINAWoe the while!O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,Break too.First LordWhat fit is this, good lady?PAULINAWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?In leads or oils? what old or newer tortureMust I receive, whose every word deservesTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyrannyTogether working with thy jealousies,Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idleFor girls of nine, O, think what they have doneAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for allThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstantAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckonThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughterTo be or none or little; though a devilWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:Nor is't directly laid to thee, the deathOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heartThat could conceive a gross and foolish sireBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,and vengeance for'tNot dropp'd down yet.First LordThe higher powers forbid!PAULINAI say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oathPrevail not, go and see: if you can bringTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve youAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!Do not repent these things, for they are heavierThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake theeTo nothing but despair. A thousand kneesTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,Upon a barren mountain and still winterIn storm perpetual, could not move the godsTo look that way thou wert.LEONTESGo on, go onThou canst not speak too much; I have deservedAll tongues to talk their bitterest.First LordSay no more:Howe'er the business goes, you have made faultI' the boldness of your speech.PAULINAI am sorry for't:All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too muchThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'dTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past helpShould be past grief: do not receive afflictionAt my petition; I beseech you, ratherLet me be punish'd, that have minded youOf what you should forget. Now, good my liegeSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;I'll not remember you of my own lord,Who is lost too: take your patience to you,And I'll say nothing.LEONTESThou didst speak but wellWhen most the truth; which I receive much betterThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring meTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:One grave shall be for both: upon them shallThe causes of their death appear, untoOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visitThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed thereShall be my recreation: so long as natureWill bear up with this exercise, so longI daily vow to use it. Come and lead meUnto these sorrows.ExeuntSCENE III. Bohemia.

In my conscience,The heavens with that we have in hand are angryAnd frown upon 's.ANTIGONUSTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;Look to thy bark: I'll not be long beforeI call upon thee.MarinerMake your best haste, and go notToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;Besides, this place is famous for the creaturesOf prey that keep upon't.ANTIGONUSGo thou away:I'll follow instantly.MarinerI am glad at heartTo be so rid o' the business.ExitANTIGONUSCome, poor babe:I have heard, but not believed,the spirits o' the deadMay walk again: if such thing be, thy motherAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dreamSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,Sometimes her head on one side, some another;I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,Like very sanctity, she did approachMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,And gasping to begin some speech, her eyesBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anonDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,Since fate, against thy better disposition,Hath made thy person for the thrower-outOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,Places remote enough are in Bohemia,There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babeIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,I prithee, call't. For this ungentle businessPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt seeThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieksShe melted into air. Affrighted much,I did in time collect myself and thoughtThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,I will be squared by this. I do believeHermione hath suffer'd death, and thatApollo would, this being indeed the issueOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,Either for life or death, upon the earthOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!There lie, and there thy character: there these;Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,That for thy mother's fault art thus exposedTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am ITo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to haveA lullaby too rough: I never sawThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:I am gone for ever.Exit, pursued by a bearEnter a ShepherdShepherdI would there were no age between sixteen andthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out therest; for there is nothing in the between butgetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any butthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twentyhunt this weather? They have scared away two of mybest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner findthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis bythe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thywill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a verypretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? Apretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:though I am not bookish, yet I can readwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has beensome stair-work, some trunk-work, somebehind-door-work: they were warmer that got thisthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up forpity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooedbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!Enter ClownClownHilloa, loa!ShepherdWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talkon when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. Whatailest thou, man?ClownI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now thesky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrusta bodkin's point.ShepherdWhy, boy, how is it?ClownI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,how it takes up the shore! but that's not thepoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now theship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anonswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust acork into a hogshead. And then for theland-service, to see how the bear tore out hisshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and saidhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make anend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragonedit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and thesea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roaredand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder thanthe sea or weather.ShepherdName of mercy, when was this, boy?ClownNow, now: I have not winked since I saw thesesights: the men are not yet cold under water, northe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at itnow.ShepherdWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!ClownI would you had been by the ship side, to havehelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.ShepherdHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thingsdying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight forthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire'schild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should berich by the fairies. This is some changeling:open't. What's within, boy?ClownYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youthare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!ShepherdThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: upwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requiresnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, goodboy, the next way home.ClownGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go seeif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how muchhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when theyare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll buryit.ShepherdThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by thatwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to thesight of him.ClownMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.Shepherd'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I:Enter Time, the ChorusTimeI, that please some, try all, both joy and terrorOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,Now take upon me, in the name of Time,To use my wings. Impute it not a crimeTo me or my swift passage, that I slideO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untriedOf that wide gap, since it is in my powerTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hourTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me passThe same I am, ere ancient'st order wasOr what is now received: I witness toThe times that brought them in; so shall I doTo the freshest things now reigning and make staleThe glistering of this present, as my taleNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,I turn my glass and give my scene such growingAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,The effects of his fond jealousies so grievingThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,Gentle spectators, that I now may beIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,I mentioned a son o' the king's, which FlorizelI now name to you; and with speed so paceTo speak of Perdita, now grown in graceEqual with wondering: what of her ensuesI list not prophecy; but let Time's newsBe known when 'tis brought forth.A shepherd's daughter,And what to her adheres, which follows after,Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,If ever you have spent time worse ere now;If never, yet that Time himself doth sayHe wishes earnestly you never may.ExitSCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLOPOLIXENESI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death togrant this.CAMILLOIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: thoughI have for the most part been aired abroad, Idesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitentking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feelingsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween tothink so, which is another spur to my departure.POLIXENESAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest ofthy services by leaving me now: the need I have ofthee thine own goodness hath made; better not tohave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, havingmade me businesses which none without thee cansufficiently manage, must either stay to executethem thyself or take away with thee the veryservices thou hast done; which if I have not enoughconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be morethankful to thee shall be my study, and my profittherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatalcountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose verynaming punishes me with the remembrance of thatpenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,my brother; whose loss of his most precious queenand children are even now to be afresh lamented.Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, myson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue notbeing gracious, than they are in losing them whenthey have approved their virtues.CAMILLOSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. Whathis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but Ihave missingly noted, he is of late much retiredfrom court and is less frequent to his princelyexercises than formerly he hath appeared.POLIXENESI have considered so much, Camillo, and with somecare; so far that I have eyes under my service whichlook upon his removedness; from whom I have thisintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of amost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that fromvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of hisneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.CAMILLOI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath adaughter of most rare note: the report of her isextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.POLIXENESThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, Ifear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thoushalt accompany us to the place; where we will, notappearing what we are, have some question with theshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it notuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.Prithee, be my present partner in this business, andlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.CAMILLOI willingly obey your command.POLIXENESMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.ExeuntSCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.Enter AUTOLYCUS, singingAUTOLYCUSWhen daffodils begin to peer,With heigh! the doxy over the dale,Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,Are summer songs for me and my aunts,While we lie tumbling in the hay.I have served Prince Florizel and in my timewore three-pile; but now I am out of service:But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?The pale moon shines by night:And when I wander here and there,I then do most go right.If tinkers may have leave to live,And bear the sow-skin budget,Then my account I well may, give,And in the stocks avouch it.My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look tolesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; whobeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewisea snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die anddrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue isthe silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerfulon the highway: beating and hanging are terrors tome: for the life to come, I sleep out the thoughtof it. A prize! a prize!Enter ClownClownLet me see: every 'leven wether tods; every todyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundredshorn. what comes the wool to?AUTOLYCUS[Aside]If the springe hold, the cock's mine.ClownI cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what amI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three poundof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what willthis sister of mine do with rice? But my fatherhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays iton. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays forthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very goodones; but they are most of them means and bases; butone puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms tohorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the wardenpies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that Imay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many ofraisins o' the sun.AUTOLYCUSO that ever I was born!Grovelling on the groundClownI' the name of me--AUTOLYCUSO, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; andthen, death, death!ClownAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to layon thee, rather than have these off.AUTOLYCUSO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me morethan the stripes I have received, which are mightyones and millions.ClownAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to agreat matter.AUTOLYCUSI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparelta'en from me, and these detestable things put uponme.ClownWhat, by a horseman, or a footman?AUTOLYCUSA footman, sweet sir, a footman.ClownIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments hehas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.AUTOLYCUSO, good sir, tenderly, O!ClownAlas, poor soul!AUTOLYCUSO, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, myshoulder-blade is out.ClownHow now! canst stand?AUTOLYCUS[Picking his pocket]Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done mea charitable office.ClownDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.AUTOLYCUSNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I havea kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, orany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;that kills my heart.ClownWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?AUTOLYCUSA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about withtroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of theprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of hisvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.ClownHis vices, you would say; there's no virtue whippedout of the court: they cherish it to make it staythere; and yet it will no more but abide.AUTOLYCUSVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: hehath been since an ape-bearer; then aprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed amotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker'swife within a mile where my land and living lies;and, having flown over many knavish professions, hesettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.ClownOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he hauntswakes, fairs and bear-baitings.AUTOLYCUSVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue thatput me into this apparel.ClownNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you hadbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.AUTOLYCUSI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I amfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warranthim.ClownHow do you now?AUTOLYCUSSweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand andwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pacesoftly towards my kinsman's.ClownShall I bring thee on the way?AUTOLYCUSNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.ClownThen fare thee well: I must go buy spices for oursheep-shearing.AUTOLYCUSProsper you, sweet sir!Exit ClownYour purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if Imake not this cheat bring out another and theshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my nameput in the book of virtue!SingsJog on, jog on, the foot-path way,And merrily hent the stile-a:A merry heart goes all the day,Your sad tires in a mile-a.ExitSCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITAFLORIZELThese your unusual weeds to each part of youDo give a life: no shepherdess, but FloraPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearingIs as a meeting of the petty gods,And you the queen on't.PERDITASir, my gracious lord,To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscuredWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feastsIn every mess have folly and the feedersDigest it with a custom, I should blushTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,To show myself a glass.FLORIZELI bless the timeWhen my good falcon made her flight acrossThy father's ground.PERDITANow Jove afford you cause!To me the difference forges dread; your greatnessHath not been used to fear. Even now I trembleTo think your father, by some accident,Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!How would he look, to see his work so nobleVilely bound up? What would he say? Or howShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, beholdThe sternness of his presence?FLORIZELApprehendNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,Humbling their deities to love, have takenThe shapes of beasts upon them: JupiterBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green NeptuneA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,As I seem now. Their transformationsWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,Nor in a way so chaste, since my desiresRun not before mine honour, nor my lustsBurn hotter than my faith.PERDITAO, but, sir,Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tisOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:One of these two must be necessities,Which then will speak, that you mustchange this purpose,Or I my life.FLORIZELThou dearest Perdita,With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken notThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,Or not my father's. For I cannot beMine own, nor any thing to any, ifI be not thine. To this I am most constant,Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;Strangle such thoughts as these with any thingThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:Lift up your countenance, as it were the dayOf celebration of that nuptial whichWe two have sworn shall come.PERDITAO lady Fortune,Stand you auspicious!FLORIZELSee, your guests approach:Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,And let's be red with mirth.Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguisedShepherdFie, daughter! when my old wife lived, uponThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fireWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,She would to each one sip. You are retired,As if you were a feasted one and notThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bidThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it isA way to make us better friends, more known.Come, quench your blushes and present yourselfThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,As your good flock shall prosper.PERDITA[To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:It is my father's will I should take on meThe hostess-ship o' the day.To CAMILLOYou're welcome, sir.Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,For you there's rosemary and rue; these keepSeeming and savour all the winter long:Grace and remembrance be to you both,And welcome to our shearing!POLIXENESShepherdess,A fair one are you--well you fit our agesWith flowers of winter.PERDITASir, the year growing ancient,Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birthOf trembling winter, the fairestflowers o' the seasonAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,Which some call nature's bastards: of that kindOur rustic garden's barren; and I care notTo get slips of them.POLIXENESWherefore, gentle maiden,Do you neglect them?PERDITAFor I have heard it saidThere is an art which in their piedness sharesWith great creating nature.POLIXENESSay there be;Yet nature is made better by no meanBut nature makes that mean: so, over that artWhich you say adds to nature, is an artThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marryA gentler scion to the wildest stock,And make conceive a bark of baser kindBy bud of nobler race: this is an artWhich does mend nature, change it rather, butThe art itself is nature.PERDITASo it is.POLIXENESThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,And do not call them bastards.PERDITAI'll not putThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;No more than were I painted I would wishThis youth should say 'twere well and only thereforeDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sunAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowersOf middle summer, and I think they are givenTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.CAMILLOI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,And only live by gazing.PERDITAOut, alas!You'd be so lean, that blasts of JanuaryWould blow you through and through.Now, my fair'st friend,I would I had some flowers o' the spring that mightBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,That wear upon your virgin branches yetYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fallFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,That come before the swallow dares, and takeThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyesOr Cytherea's breath; pale primrosesThat die unmarried, ere they can beholdBight Phoebus in his strength--a maladyMost incident to maids; bold oxlips andThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,To strew him o'er and o'er!FLORIZELWhat, like a corse?PERDITANo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:Methinks I play as I have seen them doIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mineDoes change my disposition.FLORIZELWhat you doStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish youA wave o' the sea, that you might ever doNothing but that; move still, still so,And own no other function: each your doing,So singular in each particular,Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,That all your acts are queens.PERDITAO Doricles,Your praises are too large: but that your youth,And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,You woo'd me the false way.FLORIZELI think you haveAs little skill to fear as I have purposeTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,That never mean to part.PERDITAI'll swear for 'em.POLIXENESThis is the prettiest low-born lass that everRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seemsBut smacks of something greater than herself,Too noble for this place.CAMILLOHe tells her somethingThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she isThe queen of curds and cream.ClownCome on, strike up!DORCASMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,To mend her kissing with!MOPSANow, in good time!ClownNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.Come, strike up!Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and ShepherdessesPOLIXENESPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is thisWhich dances with your daughter?ShepherdThey call him Doricles; and boasts himselfTo have a worthy feeding: but I have itUpon his own report and I believe it;He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:I think so too; for never gazed the moonUpon the water as he'll stand and readAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.I think there is not half a kiss to chooseWho loves another best.POLIXENESShe dances featly.ShepherdSo she does any thing; though I report it,That should be silent: if young DoriclesDo light upon her, she shall bring him thatWhich he not dreams of.Enter ServantServantO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at thedoor, you would never dance again after a tabour andpipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he singsseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; heutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men'sears grew to his tunes.ClownHe could never come better; he shall come in. Ilove a ballad but even too well, if it be dolefulmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thingindeed and sung lamentably.ServantHe hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; nomilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: hehas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so withoutbawdry, which is strange; with such delicateburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thumpher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap intothe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do meno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'POLIXENESThis is a brave fellow.ClownBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceitedfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?ServantHe hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia canlearnedly handle, though they come to him by thegross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, hesings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; youwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chantsto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.ClownPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.PERDITAForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.Exit ServantClownYou have of these pedlars, that have more in themthan you'ld think, sister.PERDITAAy, good brother, or go about to think.Enter AUTOLYCUS, singingAUTOLYCUSLawn as white as driven snow;Cyprus black as e'er was crow;Gloves as sweet as damask roses;Masks for faces and for noses;Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,Perfume for a lady's chamber;Golden quoifs and stomachers,For my lads to give their dears:Pins and poking-sticks of steel,What maids lack from head to heel:Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.ClownIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst takeno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, itwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.MOPSAI was promised them against the feast; but they comenot too late now.DORCASHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.MOPSAHe hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he haspaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.ClownIs there no manners left among maids? will theywear their plackets where they should bear theirfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you aregoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off thesesecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before allour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamouryour tongues, and not a word more.MOPSAI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-laceand a pair of sweet gloves.ClownHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the wayand lost all my money?AUTOLYCUSAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;therefore it behoves men to be wary.ClownFear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.AUTOLYCUSI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.ClownWhat hast here? ballads?MOPSAPray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'life, for then we are sure they are true.AUTOLYCUSHere's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer'swife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at aburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads andtoads carbonadoed.MOPSAIs it true, think you?AUTOLYCUSVery true, and but a month old.DORCASBless me from marrying a usurer!AUTOLYCUSHere's the midwife's name to't, one MistressTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that werepresent.

I know, sir, we weary you.POLIXENESYou weary those that refresh us: pray, let's seethese four threes of herdsmen.ServantOne three of them, by their own report, sir, hathdanced before the king; and not the worst of thethree but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.ShepherdLeave your prating: since these good men arepleased, let them come in; but quickly now.ServantWhy, they stay at door, sir.ExitHere a dance of twelve SatyrsPOLIXENESO, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.To CAMILLOIs it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.He's simple and tells much.To FLORIZELHow now, fair shepherd!Your heart is full of something that does takeYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was youngAnd handed love as you do, I was wontTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'dThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd itTo her acceptance; you have let him goAnd nothing marted with him. If your lassInterpretation should abuse and call thisYour lack of love or bounty, you were straitedFor a reply, at least if you make a careOf happy holding her.FLORIZELOld sir, I knowShe prizes not such trifles as these are:The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'dUp in my heart; which I have given already,But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my lifeBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,As soft as dove's down and as white as it,Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'dsnow that's boltedBy the northern blasts twice o'er.POLIXENESWhat follows this?How prettily the young swain seems to washThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:But to your protestation; let me hearWhat you profess.FLORIZELDo, and be witness to 't.POLIXENESAnd this my neighbour too?FLORIZELAnd he, and moreThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youthThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledgeMore than was ever man's, I would not prize themWithout her love; for her employ them all;Commend them and condemn them to her serviceOr to their own perdition.POLIXENESFairly offer'd.CAMILLOThis shows a sound affection.ShepherdBut, my daughter,Say you the like to him?PERDITAI cannot speakSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut outThe purity of his.ShepherdTake hands, a bargain!And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:I give my daughter to him, and will makeHer portion equal his.FLORIZELO, that must beI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,I shall have more than you can dream of yet;Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.ShepherdCome, your hand;And, daughter, yours.POLIXENESSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;Have you a father?FLORIZELI have: but what of him?POLIXENESKnows he of this?FLORIZELHe neither does nor shall.POLIXENESMethinks a fatherIs at the nuptial of his son a guestThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,Is not your father grown incapableOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupidWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?Know man from man? dispute his own estate?Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothingBut what he did being childish?FLORIZELNo, good sir;He has his health and ampler strength indeedThan most have of his age.POLIXENESBy my white beard,You offer him, if this be so, a wrongSomething unfilial: reason my sonShould choose himself a wife, but as good reasonThe father, all whose joy is nothing elseBut fair posterity, should hold some counselIn such a business.FLORIZELI yield all this;But for some other reasons, my grave sir,Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaintMy father of this business.POLIXENESLet him know't.FLORIZELHe shall not.POLIXENESPrithee, let him.FLORIZELNo, he must not.ShepherdLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieveAt knowing of thy choice.FLORIZELCome, come, he must not.Mark our contract.POLIXENESMark your divorce, young sir,Discovering himselfWhom son I dare not call; thou art too baseTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,I am sorry that by hanging thee I canBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh pieceOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must knowThe royal fool thou copest with,--ShepherdO, my heart!POLIXENESI'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and madeMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,If I may ever know thou dost but sighThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as neverI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,Though full of our displeasure, yet we free theeFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,That makes himself, but for our honour therein,Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thouThese rural latches to his entrance open,Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,I will devise a death as cruel for theeAs thou art tender to't.ExitPERDITAEven here undone!I was not much afeard; for once or twiceI was about to speak and tell him plainly,The selfsame sun that shines upon his courtHides not his visage from our cottage butLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?I told you what would come of this: beseech you,Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,But milk my ewes and weep.CAMILLOWhy, how now, father!Speak ere thou diest.ShepherdI cannot speak, nor thinkNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!You have undone a man of fourscore three,That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,To die upon the bed my father died,To lie close by his honest bones: but nowSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay meWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,That knew'st this was the prince,and wouldst adventureTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!If I might die within this hour, I have livedTo die when I desire.ExitFLORIZELWhy look you so upon me?I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;More straining on for plucking back, not followingMy leash unwillingly.CAMILLOGracious my lord,You know your father's temper: at this timeHe will allow no speech, which I do guessYou do not purpose to him; and as hardlyWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:Then, till the fury of his highness settle,Come not before him.FLORIZELI not purpose it.I think, Camillo?CAMILLOEven he, my lord.PERDITAHow often have I told you 'twould be thus!How often said, my dignity would lastBut till 'twere known!FLORIZELIt cannot fail but byThe violation of my faith; and thenLet nature crush the sides o' the earth togetherAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:From my succession wipe me, father; IAm heir to my affection.CAMILLOBe advised.FLORIZELI am, and by my fancy: if my reasonWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,Do bid it welcome.CAMILLOThis is desperate, sir.FLORIZELSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow;I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that mayBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees orThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hidesIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oathTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean notTo see him any more,--cast your good counselsUpon his passion; let myself and fortuneTug for the time to come. This you may knowAnd so deliver, I am put to seaWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;And most opportune to our need I haveA vessel rides fast by, but not preparedFor this design. What course I mean to holdShall nothing benefit your knowledge, norConcern me the reporting.CAMILLOO my lord!I would your spirit were easier for advice,Or stronger for your need.FLORIZELHark, PerditaDrawing her asideI'll hear you by and by.CAMILLOHe's irremoveable,Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, ifHis going I could frame to serve my turn,Save him from danger, do him love and honour,Purchase the sight again of dear SiciliaAnd that unhappy king, my master, whomI so much thirst to see.FLORIZELNow, good Camillo;I am so fraught with curious business thatI leave out ceremony.CAMILLOSir, I thinkYou have heard of my poor services, i' the loveThat I have borne your father?FLORIZELVery noblyHave you deserved: it is my father's musicTo speak your deeds, not little of his careTo have them recompensed as thought on.CAMILLOWell, my lord,If you may please to think I love the kingAnd through him what is nearest to him, which isYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:If your more ponderous and settled projectMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,I'll point you where you shall have such receivingAs shall become your highness; where you mayEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,There's no disjunction to be made, but by--As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,And, with my best endeavours in your absence,Your discontenting father strive to qualifyAnd bring him up to liking.FLORIZELHow, Camillo,May this, almost a miracle, be done?That I may call thee something more than manAnd after that trust to thee.CAMILLOHave you thought onA place whereto you'll go?FLORIZELNot any yet:But as the unthought-on accident is guiltyTo what we wildly do, so we professOurselves to be the slaves of chance and fliesOf every wind that blows.CAMILLOThen list to me:This follows, if you will not change your purposeBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,And there present yourself and your fair princess,For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:She shall be habited as it becomesThe partner of your bed. Methinks I seeLeontes opening his free arms and weepingHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the handsOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the oneHe chides to hell and bids the other growFaster than thought or time.FLORIZELWorthy Camillo,What colour for my visitation shall IHold up before him?CAMILLOSent by the king your fatherTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,The manner of your bearing towards him, withWhat you as from your father shall deliver,Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:The which shall point you forth at every sittingWhat you must say; that he shall not perceiveBut that you have your father's bosom thereAnd speak his very heart.FLORIZELI am bound to you:There is some sap in this.CAMILLOA cause more promisingThan a wild dedication of yourselvesTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certainTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,But as you shake off one to take another;Nothing so certain as your anchors, whoDo their best office, if they can but stay youWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you knowProsperity's the very bond of love,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart togetherAffliction alters.PERDITAOne of these is true:I think affliction may subdue the cheek,But not take in the mind.CAMILLOYea, say you so?There shall not at your father's house theseseven yearsBe born another such.FLORIZELMy good Camillo,She is as forward of her breeding asShe is i' the rear our birth.CAMILLOI cannot say 'tis pityShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistressTo most that teach.PERDITAYour pardon, sir; for thisI'll blush you thanks.FLORIZELMy prettiest Perdita!But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,Preserver of my father, now of me,The medicine of our house, how shall we do?We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.CAMILLOMy lord,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunesDo all lie there: it shall be so my careTo have you royally appointed as ifThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,That you may know you shall not want, one word.They talk asideRe-enter AUTOLYCUSAUTOLYCUSHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, hissworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have soldall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not aribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng whoshould buy first, as if my trinkets had beenhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:by which means I saw whose purse was best inpicture; and what I saw, to my good use Iremembered. My clown, who wants but something tobe a reasonable man, grew so in love with thewenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoestill he had both tune and words; which so drew therest of the herd to me that all their other sensesstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, itwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of apurse; I could have filed keys off that hung inchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in thistime of lethargy I picked and cut most of theirfestival purses; and had not the old man come inwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king'sson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had notleft a purse alive in the whole army.CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forwardCAMILLONay, but my letters, by this means being thereSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.FLORIZELAnd those that you'll procure from King Leontes--CAMILLOShall satisfy your father.PERDITAHappy be you!All that you speak shows fair.CAMILLOWho have we here?Seeing AUTOLYCUSWe'll make an instrument of this, omitNothing may give us aid.AUTOLYCUSIf they have overheard me now, why, hanging.CAMILLOHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fearnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.AUTOLYCUSI am a poor fellow, sir.CAMILLOWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that fromthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we mustmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--andchange garments with this gentleman: though thepennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,there's some boot.AUTOLYCUSI am a poor fellow, sir.AsideI know ye well enough.CAMILLONay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is halfflayed already.AUTOLYCUSAre you in earnest, sir?AsideI smell the trick on't.FLORIZELDispatch, I prithee.AUTOLYCUSIndeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot withconscience take it.CAMILLOUnbuckle, unbuckle.FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garmentsFortunate mistress,--let my prophecyCome home to ye!--you must retire yourselfInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hatAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,Dismantle you, and, as you can, dislikenThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--For I do fear eyes over--to shipboardGet undescried.PERDITAI see the play so liesThat I must bear a part.CAMILLONo remedy.Have you done there?FLORIZELShould I now meet my father,He would not call me son.CAMILLONay, you shall have no hat.Giving it to PERDITACome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.AUTOLYCUSAdieu, sir.FLORIZELO Perdita, what have we twain forgot!Pray you, a word.CAMILLO[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the kingOf this escape and whither they are bound;Wherein my hope is I shall so prevailTo force him after: in whose companyI shall review Sicilia, for whose sightI have a woman's longing.FLORIZELFortune speed us!Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.CAMILLOThe swifter speed the better.Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLOAUTOLYCUSI understand the business, I hear it: to have anopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, isnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisitealso, to smell out work for the other senses. I seethis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.What an exchange had this been without boot! Whata boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods dothis year connive at us, and we may do any thingextempore. The prince himself is about a piece ofiniquity, stealing away from his father with hisclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece ofhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would notdo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;and therein am I constant to my profession.Re-enter Clown and ShepherdAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:every lane's end, every shop, church, session,hanging, yields a careful man work.ClownSee, see; what a man you are now!There is no other way but to tell the kingshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.ShepherdNay, but hear me.ClownNay, but hear me.ShepherdGo to, then.ClownShe being none of your flesh and blood, your fleshand blood has not offended the king; and so yourflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Showthose things you found about her, those secretthings, all but what she has with her: this beingdone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.ShepherdI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and hisson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,neither to his father nor to me, to go about to makeme the king's brother-in-law.ClownIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off youcould have been to him and then your blood had beenthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.AUTOLYCUS[Aside] Very wisely, puppies!ShepherdWell, let us to the king: there is that in thisfardel will make him scratch his beard.AUTOLYCUS[Aside] I know not what impediment this complaintmay be to the flight of my master.ClownPray heartily he be at palace.AUTOLYCUS[Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am sosometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.Takes off his false beardHow now, rustics! whither are you bound?ShepherdTo the palace, an it like your worship.AUTOLYCUSYour affairs there, what, with whom, the conditionof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, yournames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known, discover.ClownWe are but plain fellows, sir.AUTOLYCUSA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have nolying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and theyoften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them forit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; thereforethey do not give us the lie.ClownYour worship had like to have given us one, if youhad not taken yourself with the manner.ShepherdAre you a courtier, an't like you, sir?AUTOLYCUSWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seestthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect Inot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thybusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtiercap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluckback thy business there: whereupon I command thee toopen thy affair.ShepherdMy business, sir, is to the king.AUTOLYCUSWhat advocate hast thou to him?ShepherdI know not, an't like you.ClownAdvocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say youhave none.ShepherdNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.AUTOLYCUSHow blessed are we that are not simple men!Yet nature might have made me as these are,Therefore I will not disdain.ClownThis cannot be but a great courtier.ShepherdHis garments are rich, but he wearsthem not handsomely.ClownHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the pickingon's teeth.AUTOLYCUSThe fardel there? what's i' the fardel?Wherefore that box?ShepherdSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,which none must know but the king; and which heshall know within this hour, if I may come to thespeech of him.AUTOLYCUSAge, thou hast lost thy labour.ShepherdWhy, sir?AUTOLYCUSThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard anew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,if thou beest capable of things serious, thou mustknow the king is full of grief.ShepardSo 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should havemarried a shepherd's daughter.AUTOLYCUSIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:the curses he shall have, the tortures he shallfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.ClownThink you so, sir?AUTOLYCUSNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavyand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane tohim, though removed fifty times, shall all comeunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue aram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come intograce! Some say he shall be stoned; but that deathis too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into asheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.ClownHas the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'tlike you, sir?AUTOLYCUSHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then'nointed over with honey, set on the head of awasp's nest; then stand till he be three quartersand a dram dead; then recovered again withaqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw ashe is, and in the hottest day prognosticationproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, thesun looking with a southward eye upon him, where heis to behold him with flies blown to death. But whattalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseriesare to be smiled at, their offences being socapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plainmen, what you have to the king: being somethinggently considered, I'll bring you where he isaboard, tender your persons to his presence,whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in manbesides the king to effect your suits, here is manshall do it.ClownHe seems to be of great authority: close with him,give him gold; and though authority be a stubbornbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: showthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'ShepherdAn't please you, sir, to undertake the business forus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as muchmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.AUTOLYCUSAfter I have done what I promised?ShepherdAy, sir.AUTOLYCUSWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?ClownIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitifulone, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.AUTOLYCUSO, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,he'll be made an example.ClownComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and showour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of yourdaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, Iwill give you as much as this old man does when thebusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, yourpawn till it be brought you.AUTOLYCUSI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;go on the right hand: I will but look upon thehedge and follow you.ClownWe are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.ShepherdLet's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.Exeunt Shepherd and ClownAUTOLYCUSIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune wouldnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I amcourted now with a double occasion, gold and a meansto do the prince my master good; which who knows howthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bringthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if hethink it fit to shore them again and that thecomplaint they have to the king concerns himnothing, let him call me rogue for being so farofficious; for I am proof against that title andwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I presentthem: there may be matter in it.ExitACT VSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and ServantsCLEOMENESSir, you have done enough, and have perform'dA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid downMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;With them forgive yourself.LEONTESWhilst I rememberHer and her virtues, I cannot forgetMy blemishes in them, and so still think ofThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,That heirless it hath made my kingdom andDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er manBred his hopes out of.PAULINATrue, too true, my lord:If, one by one, you wedded all the world,Or from the all that are took something good,To make a perfect woman, she you kill'dWould be unparallel'd.LEONTESI think so. Kill'd!She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest meSorely, to say I did; it is as bitterUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,Say so but seldom.CLEOMENESNot at all, good lady:You might have spoken a thousand things that wouldHave done the time more benefit and gracedYour kindness better.PAULINAYou are one of thoseWould have him wed again.DIONIf you would not so,You pity not the state, nor the remembranceOf his most sovereign name; consider littleWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,May drop upon his kingdom and devourIncertain lookers on. What were more holyThan to rejoice the former queen is well?What holier than, for royalty's repair,For present comfort and for future good,To bless the bed of majesty againWith a sweet fellow to't?PAULINAThere is none worthy,Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the godsWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;For has not the divine Apollo said,Is't not the tenor of his oracle,That King Leontes shall not have an heirTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,Is all as monstrous to our human reasonAs my Antigonus to break his graveAnd come again to me; who, on my life,Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counselMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,Oppose against their wills.To LEONTESCare not for issue;The crown will find an heir: great AlexanderLeft his to the worthiest; so his successorWas like to be the best.LEONTESGood Paulina,Who hast the memory of Hermione,I know, in honour, O, that ever IHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,Have taken treasure from her lips--PAULINAAnd left themMore rich for what they yielded.LEONTESThou speak'st truth.No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,And better used, would make her sainted spiritAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,And begin, 'Why to me?'PAULINAHad she such power,She had just cause.LEONTESShe had; and would incense meTo murder her I married.PAULINAI should so.Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you markHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in'tYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your earsShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'dShould be 'Remember mine.'LEONTESStars, stars,And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;I'll have no wife, Paulina.PAULINAWill you swearNever to marry but by my free leave?LEONTESNever, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!PAULINAThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.CLEOMENESYou tempt him over-much.PAULINAUnless another,As like Hermione as is her picture,Affront his eye.CLEOMENESGood madam,--PAULINAI have done.Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,No remedy, but you will,--give me the officeTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so youngAs was your former; but she shall be suchAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,it should take joyTo see her in your arms.LEONTESMy true Paulina,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.PAULINAThatShall be when your first queen's again in breath;Never till then.Enter a GentlemanGentlemanOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,Son of Polixenes, with his princess, sheThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires accessTo your high presence.LEONTESWhat with him? he comes notLike to his father's greatness: his approach,So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us'Tis not a visitation framed, but forcedBy need and accident. What train?GentlemanBut few,And those but mean.LEONTESHis princess, say you, with him?GentlemanAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,That e'er the sun shone bright on.PAULINAO Hermione,As every present time doth boast itselfAbove a better gone, so must thy graveGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourselfHave said and writ so, but your writing nowIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verseFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,To say you have seen a better.GentlemanPardon, madam:The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,Would she begin a sect, might quench the zealOf all professors else, make proselytesOf who she but bid follow.PAULINAHow! not women?GentlemanWomen will love her, that she is a womanMore worth than any man; men, that she isThe rarest of all women.LEONTESGo, Cleomenes;Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strangeExeunt CLEOMENES and othersHe thus should steal upon us.PAULINAHad our prince,Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'dWell with this lord: there was not full a monthBetween their births.LEONTESPrithee, no more; cease; thou know'stHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,When I shall see this gentleman, thy speechesWill bring me to consider that which mayUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITAYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;For she did print your royal father off,Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,Your father's image is so hit in you,His very air, that I should call you brother,As I did him, and speak of something wildlyBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earthMight thus have stood begetting wonder asYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--All mine own folly--the society,Amity too, of your brave father, whom,Though bearing misery, I desire my lifeOnce more to look on him.FLORIZELBy his commandHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from himGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,Can send his brother: and, but infirmityWhich waits upon worn times hath something seizedHis wish'd ability, he had himselfThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and hisMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--He bade me say so--more than all the sceptresAnd those that bear them living.LEONTESO my brother,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stirAfresh within me, and these thy offices,So rarely kind, are as interpretersOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he tooExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,To greet a man not worth her pains, much lessThe adventure of her person?FLORIZELGood my lord,She came from Libya.LEONTESWhere the warlike Smalus,That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?FLORIZELMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughterHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,To execute the charge my father gave meFor visiting your highness: my best trainI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;Who for Bohemia bend, to signifyNot only my success in Libya, sir,But my arrival and my wife's in safetyHere where we are.LEONTESThe blessed godsPurge all infection from our air whilst youDo climate here! You have a holy father,A graceful gentleman; against whose person,So sacred as it is, I have done sin:For which the heavens, taking angry note,Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,As he from heaven merits it, with youWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,Such goodly things as you!Enter a LordLordMost noble sir,That which I shall report will bear no credit,Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,Bohemia greets you from himself by me;Desires you to attach his son, who has--His dignity and duty both cast off--Fled from his father, from his hopes, and withA shepherd's daughter.LEONTESWhere's Bohemia? speak.LordHere in your city; I now came from him:I speak amazedly; and it becomesMy marvel and my message. To your courtWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,Of this fair couple, meets he on the wayThe father of this seeming lady andHer brother, having both their country quittedWith this young prince.FLORIZELCamillo has betray'd me;Whose honour and whose honesty till nowEndured all weathers.LordLay't so to his charge:He's with the king your father.LEONTESWho? Camillo?LordCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who nowHas these poor men in question. Never saw IWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;Forswear themselves as often as they speak:Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens themWith divers deaths in death.PERDITAO my poor father!The heaven sets spies upon us, will not haveOur contract celebrated.LEONTESYou are married?FLORIZELWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be;The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:The odds for high and low's alike.LEONTESMy lord,Is this the daughter of a king?FLORIZELShe is,When once she is my wife.LEONTESThat 'once' I see by your good father's speedWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,Most sorry, you have broken from his likingWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorryYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,That you might well enjoy her.FLORIZELDear, look up:Though Fortune, visible an enemy,Should chase us with my father, power no jotHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,Remember since you owed no more to timeThan I do now: with thought of such affections,Step forth mine advocate; at your requestMy father will grant precious things as trifles.LEONTESWould he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,Which he counts but a trifle.PAULINASir, my liege,Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazesThan what you look on now.LEONTESI thought of her,Even in these looks I made.To FLORIZELBut your petitionIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,I am friend to them and you: upon which errandI now go toward him; therefore follow meAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.ExeuntSCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.Enter AUTOLYCUS and a GentlemanAUTOLYCUSBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?First GentlemanI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the oldshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were allcommanded out of the chamber; only this methought Iheard the shepherd say, he found the child.AUTOLYCUSI would most gladly know the issue of it.First GentlemanI make a broken delivery of the business; but thechanges I perceived in the king and Camillo werevery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, withstaring on one another, to tear the cases of theireyes; there was speech in their dumbness, languagein their very gesture; they looked as they had heardof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notablepassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisestbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could notsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in theextremity of the one, it must needs be.Enter another GentlemanHere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.The news, Rogero?Second GentlemanNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; theking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad-makerscannot be able to express it.Enter a third GentlemanHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he candeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this newswhich is called true is so like an old tale, thatthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the kingfound his heir?Third GentlemanMost true, if ever truth were pregnant bycircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear yousee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantleof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,the letters of Antigonus found with it which theyknow to be his character, the majesty of thecreature in resemblance of the mother, the affectionof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,and many other evidences proclaim her with allcertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you seethe meeting of the two kings?Second GentlemanNo.Third GentlemanThen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld onejoy crown another, so and in such manner that itseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for theirjoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,holding up of hands, with countenances of suchdistraction that they were to be known by garment,not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out ofhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if thatjoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; thenembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he hisdaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the oldshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bittenconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of suchanother encounter, which lames report to follow itand undoes description to do it.Second GentlemanWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carriedhence the child?Third GentlemanLike an old tale still, which will have matter torehearse, though credit be asleep and not an earopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: thisavouches the shepherd's son; who has not only hisinnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but ahandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.First GentlemanWhat became of his bark and his followers?Third GentlemanWrecked the same instant of their master's death andin the view of the shepherd: so that all theinstruments which aided to expose the child wereeven then lost when it was found. But O, the noblecombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought inPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss ofher husband, another elevated that the oracle wasfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pinher to her heart that she might no more be in dangerof losing.First GentlemanThe dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes; for by such was it acted.Third GentlemanOne of the prettiest touches of all and that whichangled for mine eyes, caught the water though notthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen'sdeath, with the manner how she came to't bravelyconfessed and lamented by the king, howattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from onesign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure myheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changedcolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the worldcould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.First GentlemanAre they returned to the court?Third GentlemanNo: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece manyyears in doing and now newly performed by that rareItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himselfeternity and could put breath into his work, wouldbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is herape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione thatthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope ofanswer: thither with all greediness of affectionare they gone, and there they intend to sup.Second GentlemanI thought she had some great matter there in hand;for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, eversince the death of Hermione, visited that removedhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piecethe rejoicing?First GentlemanWho would be thence that has the benefit of access?every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.Let's along.Exeunt GentlemenAUTOLYCUSNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me,would preferment drop on my head. I brought the oldman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heardthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but heat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,so he then took her to be, who began to be muchsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity ofweather continuing, this mystery remainedundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had Ibeen the finder out of this secret, it would nothave relished among my other discredits.Enter Shepherd and ClownHere come those I have done good to against my will,and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.ShepherdCome, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons anddaughters will be all gentlemen born.ClownYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with methis other day, because I was no gentleman born.See you these clothes? say you see them not andthink me still no gentleman born: you were best saythese robes are not gentlemen born: give me thelie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.AUTOLYCUSI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.ClownAy, and have been so any time these four hours.ShepherdAnd so have I, boy.ClownSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before myfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, andcalled me brother; and then the two kings called myfather brother; and then the prince my brother andthe princess my sister called my father father; andso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-liketears that ever we shed.ShepherdWe may live, son, to shed many more.ClownAy; or else 'twere hard luck, being in sopreposterous estate as we are.AUTOLYCUSI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all thefaults I have committed to your worship and to giveme your good report to the prince my master.ShepherdPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we aregentlemen.ClownThou wilt amend thy life?AUTOLYCUSAy, an it like your good worship.ClownGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thouart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.ShepherdYou may say it, but not swear it.ClownNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors andfranklins say it, I'll swear it.ShepherdHow if it be false, son?ClownIf it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swearit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear tothe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands andthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art notall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt bedrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldstbe a tall fellow of thy hands.AUTOLYCUSI will prove so, sir, to my power.ClownAy, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do notwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, notbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kingsand the princes, our kindred, are going to see thequeen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thygood masters.ExeuntSCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and AttendantsLEONTESO grave and good Paulina, the great comfortThat I have had of thee!PAULINAWhat, sovereign sir,I did not well I meant well. All my servicesYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,With your crown'd brother and these your contractedHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,It is a surplus of your grace, which neverMy life may last to answer.LEONTESO Paulina,We honour you with trouble: but we cameTo see the statue of our queen: your galleryHave we pass'd through, not without much contentIn many singularities; but we saw notThat which my daughter came to look upon,The statue of her mother.PAULINAAs she lived peerless,So her dead likeness, I do well believe,Excels whatever yet you look'd uponOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep itLonely, apart. But here it is: prepareTo see the life as lively mock'd as everStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statueI like your silence, it the more shows offYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,Comes it not something near?LEONTESHer natural posture!Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeedThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art sheIn thy not chiding, for she was as tenderAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothingSo aged as this seems.POLIXENESO, not by much.PAULINASo much the more our carver's excellence;Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes herAs she lived now.LEONTESAs now she might have done,So much to my good comfort, as it isNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,Even with such life of majesty, warm life,As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke meFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,There's magic in thy majesty, which hasMy evils conjured to remembrance andFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,Standing like stone with thee.PERDITAAnd give me leave,And do not say 'tis superstition, thatI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,Dear queen, that ended when I but began,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.PAULINAO, patience!The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.CAMILLOMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,So many summers dry; scarce any joyDid ever so long live; no sorrowBut kill'd itself much sooner.POLIXENESDear my brother,Let him that was the cause of this have powerTo take off so much grief from you as heWill piece up in himself.PAULINAIndeed, my lord,If I had thought the sight of my poor imageWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--I'ld not have show'd it.LEONTESDo not draw the curtain.PAULINANo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancyMay think anon it moves.LEONTESLet be, let be.Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--What was he that did make it? See, my lord,Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veinsDid verily bear blood?POLIXENESMasterly done:The very life seems warm upon her lip.LEONTESThe fixture of her eye has motion in't,As we are mock'd with art.PAULINAI'll draw the curtain:My lord's almost so far transported thatHe'll think anon it lives.LEONTESO sweet Paulina,Make me to think so twenty years together!No settled senses of the world can matchThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.PAULINAI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: butI could afflict you farther.LEONTESDo, Paulina;For this affliction has a taste as sweetAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,There is an air comes from her: what fine chiselCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,For I will kiss her.PAULINAGood my lord, forbear:The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your ownWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?LEONTESNo, not these twenty years.PERDITASo long could IStand by, a looker on.PAULINAEither forbear,Quit presently the chapel, or resolve youFor more amazement. If you can behold it,I'll make the statue move indeed, descendAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--Which I protest against--I am assistedBy wicked powers.LEONTESWhat you can make her do,I am content to look on: what to speak,I am content to hear; for 'tis as easyTo make her speak as move.PAULINAIt is requiredYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;On: those that think it is unlawful businessI am about, let them depart.LEONTESProceed:No foot shall stir.PAULINAMusic, awake her; strike!Music'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,Bequeath to death your numbness, for from himDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:HERMIONE comes downStart not; her actions shall be holy asYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun herUntil you see her die again; for thenYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:When she was young you woo'd her; now in ageIs she become the suitor?LEONTESO, she's warm!If this be magic, let it be an artLawful as eating.POLIXENESShe embraces him.CAMILLOShe hangs about his neck:If she pertain to life let her speak too.POLIXENESAy, and make't manifest where she has lived,Or how stolen from the dead.PAULINAThat she is living,Were it but told you, should be hooted atLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneelAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;Our Perdita is found.HERMIONEYou gods, look downAnd from your sacred vials pour your gracesUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how foundThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,Knowing by Paulina that the oracleGave hope thou wast in being, have preservedMyself to see the issue.PAULINAThere's time enough for that;Lest they desire upon this push to troubleYour joys with like relation. Go together,You precious winners all; your exultationPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,Will wing me to some wither'd bough and thereMy mate, that's never to be found again,Lament till I am lost.LEONTESO, peace, Paulina!Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,As I by thine a wife: this is a match,And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,As I thought, dead, and have in vain said manyA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--For him, I partly know his mind--to find theeAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,And take her by the hand, whose worth and honestyIs richly noted and here justifiedBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,That e'er I put between your holy looksMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,Lead us from hence, where we may leisurelyEach one demand an answer to his partPerform'd in this wide gap of time since firstWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.ExeuntACT ISCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and AttendantsDUKE VINCENTIOEscalus.ESCALUSMy lord.DUKE VINCENTIOOf government the properties to unfold,Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;Since I am put to know that your own scienceExceeds, in that, the lists of all adviceMy strength can give you: then no more remains,But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,And let them work. The nature of our people,Our city's institutions, and the termsFor common justice, you're as pregnant inAs art and practise hath enriched anyThat we remember. There is our commission,From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,I say, bid come before us Angelo.Exit an AttendantWhat figure of us think you he will bear?For you must know, we have with special soulElected him our absence to supply,Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,And given his deputation all the organsOf our own power: what think you of it?ESCALUSIf any in Vienna be of worthTo undergo such ample grace and honour,It is Lord Angelo.DUKE VINCENTIOLook where he comes.Enter ANGELOANGELOAlways obedient to your grace's will,I come to know your pleasure.DUKE VINCENTIOAngelo,There is a kind of character in thy life,That to the observer doth thy historyFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongingsAre not thine own so proper as to wasteThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,Not light them for themselves; for if our virtuesDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alikeAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'dBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lendsThe smallest scruple of her excellenceBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determinesHerself the glory of a creditor,Both thanks and use.

We shall write to you,As time and our concernings shall importune,How it goes with us, and do look to knowWhat doth befall you here.

Give me your hand:I'll privily away.

There's not a soldier of us all, that, inthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petitionwell that prays for peace.Second GentlemanI never heard any soldier dislike it.LUCIOI believe thee; for I think thou never wast wheregrace was said.Second GentlemanNo? a dozen times at least.First GentlemanWhat, in metre?LUCIOIn any proportion or in any language.First GentlemanI think, or in any religion.LUCIOAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of allcontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art awicked villain, despite of all grace.First GentlemanWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.LUCIOI grant; as there may between the lists and thevelvet. Thou art the list.First GentlemanAnd thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rta three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as liefbe a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thouart piled, for a French velvet. Do I speakfeelingly now?LUCIOI think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painfulfeeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine ownconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst Ilive, forget to drink after thee.First GentlemanI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?Second GentlemanYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.LUCIOBehold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! Ihave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--Second GentlemanTo what, I pray?LUCIOJudge.Second GentlemanTo three thousand dolours a year.First GentlemanAy, and more.LUCIOA French crown more.First GentlemanThou art always figuring diseases in me; but thouart full of error; I am sound.LUCIONay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound asthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;impiety has made a feast of thee.Enter MISTRESS OVERDONEFirst GentlemanHow now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?MISTRESS OVERDONEWell, well; there's one yonder arrested and carriedto prison was worth five thousand of you all.Second GentlemanWho's that, I pray thee?MISTRESS OVERDONEMarry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.First GentlemanClaudio to prison? 'tis not so.MISTRESS OVERDONENay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, sawhim carried away; and, which is more, within thesethree days his head to be chopped off.LUCIOBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.Art thou sure of this?MISTRESS OVERDONEI am too sure of it: and it is for getting MadamJulietta with child.LUCIOBelieve me, this may be: he promised to meet me twohours since, and he was ever precise inpromise-keeping.Second GentlemanBesides, you know, it draws something near to thespeech we had to such a purpose.First GentlemanBut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.LUCIOAway! let's go learn the truth of it.Exeunt LUCIO and GentlemenMISTRESS OVERDONEThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, whatwith the gallows and what with poverty, I amcustom-shrunk.Enter POMPEYHow now! what's the news with you?POMPEYYonder man is carried to prison.MISTRESS OVERDONEWell; what has he done?POMPEYA woman.MISTRESS OVERDONEBut what's his offence?POMPEYGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.MISTRESS OVERDONEWhat, is there a maid with child by him?POMPEYNo, but there's a woman with maid by him.

Our natures do pursue,Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.LUCIOIf could speak so wisely under an arrest, I wouldsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to saythe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedomas the morality of imprisonment. What's thyoffence, Claudio?CLAUDIOWhat but to speak of would offend again.LUCIOWhat, is't murder?CLAUDIONo.LUCIOLechery?CLAUDIOCall it so.ProvostAway, sir! you must go.CLAUDIOOne word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.LUCIOA hundred, if they'll do you any good.Is lechery so look'd after?CLAUDIOThus stands it with me: upon a true contractI got possession of Julietta's bed:You know the lady; she is fast my wife,Save that we do the denunciation lackOf outward order: this we came not to,Only for propagation of a dowerRemaining in the coffer of her friends,From whom we thought it meet to hide our loveTill time had made them for us. But it chancesThe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.LUCIOWith child, perhaps?CLAUDIOUnhappily, even so.And the new deputy now for the duke--Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,Or whether that the body public beA horse whereon the governor doth ride,Who, newly in the seat, that it may knowHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;Whether the tyranny be in his place,Or in his emmence that fills it up,I stagger in:--but this new governorAwakes me all the enrolled penaltiesWhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wallSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone roundAnd none of them been worn; and, for a name,Now puts the drowsy and neglected actFreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.LUCIOI warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle onthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal tohim.CLAUDIOI have done so, but he's not to be found.I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:This day my sister should the cloister enterAnd there receive her approbation:Acquaint her with the danger of my state:Implore her, in my voice, that she make friendsTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:I have great hope in that; for in her youthThere is a prone and speechless dialect,Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous artWhen she will play with reason and discourse,And well she can persuade.LUCIOI pray she may; as well for the encouragement of thelike, which else would stand under grievousimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who Iwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at agame of tick-tack. I'll to her.CLAUDIOI thank you, good friend Lucio.LUCIOWithin two hours.CLAUDIOCome, officer, away!ExeuntSCENE III.

Why I desire theeTo give me secret harbour, hath a purposeMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsOf burning youth.FRIAR THOMASMay your grace speak of it?DUKE VINCENTIOMy holy sir, none better knows than youHow I have ever loved the life removedAnd held in idle price to haunt assembliesWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,A man of stricture and firm abstinence,My absolute power and place here in Vienna,And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,And so it is received. Now, pious sir,You will demand of me why I do this?FRIAR THOMASGladly, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOWe have strict statutes and most biting laws.The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,Only to stick it in their children's sightFor terror, not to use, in time the rodBecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;And liberty plucks justice by the nose;The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwartGoes all decorum.FRIAR THOMASIt rested in your graceTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:And it in you more dreadful would have seem'dThan in Lord Angelo.DUKE VINCENTIOI do fear, too dreadful:Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall themFor what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,When evil deeds have their permissive passAnd not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,I have on Angelo imposed the office;Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,And yet my nature never in the fightTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,Supply me with the habit and instruct meHow I may formally in person bear meLike a true friar. More reasons for this actionAt our more leisure shall I render you;Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confessesThat his blood flows, or that his appetiteIs more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,If power change purpose, what our seemers be.ExeuntSCENE IV. A nunnery.Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCAISABELLAAnd have you nuns no farther privileges?FRANCISCAAre not these large enough?ISABELLAYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;But rather wishing a more strict restraintUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.LUCIO[Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!ISABELLAWho's that which calls?FRANCISCAIt is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,Turn you the key, and know his business of him;You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.When you have vow'd, you must not speak with menBut in the presence of the prioress:Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.He calls again; I pray you, answer him.ExitISABELLAPeace and prosperity! Who is't that callsEnter LUCIOLUCIOHail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-rosesProclaim you are no less! Can you so stead meAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,A novice of this place and the fair sisterTo her unhappy brother Claudio?ISABELLAWhy 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,The rather for I now must make you knowI am that Isabella and his sister.LUCIOGentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.ISABELLAWoe me! for what?LUCIOFor that which, if myself might be his judge,He should receive his punishment in thanks:He hath got his friend with child.ISABELLASir, make me not your story.LUCIOIt is true.I would not--though 'tis my familiar sinWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.By your renouncement an immortal spirit,And to be talk'd with in sincerity,As with a saint.ISABELLAYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.LUCIODo not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:Your brother and his lover have embraced:As those that feed grow full, as blossoming timeThat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous wombExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.ISABELLASome one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?LUCIOIs she your cousin?ISABELLAAdoptedly; as school-maids change their namesBy vain though apt affection.LUCIOShe it is.ISABELLAO, let him marry her.LUCIOThis is the point.The duke is very strangely gone from hence;Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,In hand and hope of action: but we do learnBy those that know the very nerves of state,His givings-out were of an infinite distanceFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,And with full line of his authority,Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose bloodIs very snow-broth; one who never feelsThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,But doth rebate and blunt his natural edgeWith profits of the mind, study and fast.He--to give fear to use and liberty,Which have for long run by the hideous law,As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,Under whose heavy sense your brother's lifeFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;And follows close the rigour of the statute,To make him an example. All hope is gone,Unless you have the grace by your fair prayerTo soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business'Twixt you and your poor brother.ISABELLADoth he so seek his life?LUCIOHas censured himAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hathA warrant for his execution.ISABELLAAlas! what poor ability's in meTo do him good?LUCIOAssay the power you have.ISABELLAMy power? Alas, I doubt--LUCIOOur doubts are traitorsAnd make us lose the good we oft might winBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,All their petitions are as freely theirsAs they themselves would owe them.ISABELLAI'll see what I can do.LUCIOBut speedily.ISABELLAI will about it straight;No longer staying but to give the motherNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:Commend me to my brother: soon at nightI'll send him certain word of my success.LUCIOI take my leave of you.ISABELLAGood sir, adieu.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behindANGELOWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,And let it keep one shape, till custom make itTheir perch and not their terror.ESCALUSAy, but yetLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentlemanWhom I would save, had a most noble father!Let but your honour know,Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,That, in the working of your own affections,Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,Or that the resolute acting of your bloodCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,Whether you had not sometime in your lifeErr'd in this point which now you censure him,And pull'd the law upon you.ANGELO'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,Another thing to fall. I not deny,The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,That justice seizes: what know the lawsThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,The jewel that we find, we stoop and take'tBecause we see it; but what we do not seeWe tread upon, and never think of it.You may not so extenuate his offenceFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,When I, that censure him, do so offend,Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.ESCALUSBe it as your wisdom will.ANGELOWhere is the provost?ProvostHere, if it like your honour.ANGELOSee that ClaudioBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.Exit ProvostESCALUS[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:And some condemned for a fault alone.Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEYELBOWCome, bring them away: if these be good people ina commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses incommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.ANGELOHow now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?ELBOWIf it Please your honour, I am the poor duke'sconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean uponjustice, sir, and do bring in here before your goodhonour two notorious benefactors.ANGELOBenefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? arethey not malefactors?ELBOWIf it? please your honour, I know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that I am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood Christians ought to have.ESCALUSThis comes off well; here's a wise officer.ANGELOGo to: what quality are they of? Elbow is yourname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?POMPEYHe cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.ANGELOWhat are you, sir?ELBOWHe, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one thatserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as theysay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now sheprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.ESCALUSHow know you that?ELBOWMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--ESCALUSHow? thy wife?ELBOWAy, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--ESCALUSDost thou detest her therefore?ELBOWI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well asshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.ESCALUSHow dost thou know that, constable?ELBOWMarry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a womancardinally given, might have been accused infornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.ESCALUSBy the woman's means?ELBOWAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as shespit in his face, so she defied him.POMPEYSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.ELBOWProve it before these varlets here, thou honourableman; prove it.ESCALUSDo you hear how he misplaces?POMPEYSir, she came in great with child; and longing,saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;sir, we had but two in the house, which at that verydistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, adish of some three-pence; your honours have seensuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but verygood dishes,--ESCALUSGo to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.POMPEYNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein inthe right: but to the point. As I say, thisMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, andbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, forprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten therest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them veryhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I couldnot give you three-pence again.FROTHNo, indeed.POMPEYVery well: you being then, if you be remembered,cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--FROTHAy, so I did indeed.POMPEYWhy, very well; I telling you then, if you beremembered, that such a one and such a one were pastcure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept verygood diet, as I told you,--FROTHAll this is true.POMPEYWhy, very well, then,--ESCALUSCome, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. Whatwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause tocomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.POMPEYSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.ESCALUSNo, sir, nor I mean it not.POMPEYSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour'sleave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Frothhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whosefather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,Master Froth?FROTHAll-hallond eve.POMPEYWhy, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas inthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delightto sit, have you not?FROTHI have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.POMPEYWhy, very well, then; I hope here be truths.ANGELOThis will last out a night in Russia,When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.And leave you to the hearing of the cause;Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.ESCALUSI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.Exit ANGELONow, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?POMPEYOnce, sir? there was nothing done to her once.ELBOWI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.POMPEYI beseech your honour, ask me.ESCALUSWell, sir; what did this gentleman to her?POMPEYI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for agood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?ESCALUSAy, sir, very well.POMPEYNay; I beseech you, mark it well.ESCALUSWell, I do so.POMPEYDoth your honour see any harm in his face?ESCALUSWhy, no.POMPEYI'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worstthing about him. Good, then; if his face be theworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do theconstable's wife any harm? I would know that ofyour honour.ESCALUSHe's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?ELBOWFirst, an it like you, the house is a respectedhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and hismistress is a respected woman.POMPEYBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respectedperson than any of us all.ELBOWVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! thetime has yet to come that she was ever respectedwith man, woman, or child.POMPEYSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.ESCALUSWhich is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Isthis true?ELBOWO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wickedHannibal! I respected with her before I was marriedto her! If ever I was respected with her, or shewith me, let not your worship think me the poorduke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, orI'll have mine action of battery on thee.ESCALUSIf he took you a box o' the ear, you might have youraction of slander too.ELBOWMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is'tyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?ESCALUSTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in himthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let himcontinue in his courses till thou knowest what theyare.ELBOWMarry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thouwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou artto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.ESCALUSWhere were you born, friend?FROTHHere in Vienna, sir.ESCALUSAre you of fourscore pounds a year?FROTHYes, an't please you, sir.ESCALUSSo. What trade are you of, sir?POMPHEYTapster; a poor widow's tapster.ESCALUSYour mistress' name?POMPHEYMistress Overdone.ESCALUSHath she had any more than one husband?POMPEYNine, sir; Overdone by the last.ESCALUSNine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. MasterFroth, I would not have you acquainted withtapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and youwill hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear nomore of you.FROTHI thank your worship. For mine own part, I nevercome into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawnin.ESCALUSWell, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.Exit FROTHCome you hither to me, Master tapster. What's yourname, Master tapster?POMPEYPompey.ESCALUSWhat else?POMPEYBum, sir.ESCALUSTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey theGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are younot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.POMPEYTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.ESCALUSHow would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? Whatdo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?POMPEYIf the law would allow it, sir.ESCALUSBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shallnot be allowed in Vienna.POMPEYDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all theyouth of the city?ESCALUSNo, Pompey.POMPEYTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.If your worship will take order for the drabs andthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.ESCALUSThere are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:it is but heading and hanging.POMPEYIf you head and hang all that offend that way butfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out acommission for more heads: if this law hold inVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in itafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see thiscome to pass, say Pompey told you so.ESCALUSThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of yourprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not findyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewdCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shallhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.POMPEYI thank your worship for your good counsel:Asidebut I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shallbetter determine.Whip me?

You say, seven years together?ELBOWAnd a half, sir.ESCALUSAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do youwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not menin your ward sufficient to serve it?ELBOWFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as theyare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; Ido it for some piece of money, and go through withall.ESCALUSLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven,the most sufficient of your parish.ELBOWTo your worship's house, sir?ESCALUSTo my house. Fare you well.Exit ELBOWWhat's o'clock, think you?JusticeEleven, sir.ESCALUSI pray you home to dinner with me.JusticeI humbly thank you.ESCALUSIt grieves me for the death of Claudio;But there's no remedy.JusticeLord Angelo is severe.ESCALUSIt is but needful:Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.Come, sir.ExeuntSCENE II.

Provost?ProvostIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?ANGELODid not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?Why dost thou ask again?ProvostLest I might be too rash:Under your good correction, I have seen,When, after execution, judgment hathRepented o'er his doom.ANGELOGo to; let that be mine:Do you your office, or give up your place,And you shall well be spared.ProvostI crave your honour's pardon.What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?She's very near her hour.ANGELODispose of herTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.Re-enter ServantServantHere is the sister of the man condemn'dDesires access to you.ANGELOHath he a sister?ProvostAy, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,And to be shortly of a sisterhood,If not already.ANGELOWell, let her be admitted.Exit ServantSee you the fornicatress be removed:Let have needful, but not lavish, means;There shall be order for't.Enter ISABELLA and LUCIOProvostGod save your honour!ANGELOStay a little while.To ISABELLAYou're welcome: what's your will?ISABELLAI am a woeful suitor to your honour,Please but your honour hear me.ANGELOWell; what's your suit?ISABELLAThere is a vice that most I do abhor,And most desire should meet the blow of justice;For which I would not plead, but that I must;For which I must not plead, but that I amAt war 'twixt will and will not.ANGELOWell; the matter?ISABELLAI have a brother is condemn'd to die:I do beseech you, let it be his fault,And not my brother.Provost[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!ANGELOCondemn the fault and not the actor of it?Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:Mine were the very cipher of a function,To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,And let go by the actor.ISABELLAO just but severe law!I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to himagain, entreat him;Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:You are too cold; if you should need a pin,You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:To him, I say!ISABELLAMust he needs die?ANGELOMaiden, no remedy.ISABELLAYes; I do think that you might pardon him,And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.ANGELOI will not do't.ISABELLABut can you, if you would?ANGELOLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.ISABELLABut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,If so your heart were touch'd with that remorseA s mine is to him?ANGELOHe's sentenced; 'tis too late.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.ISABELLAToo late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.May call it back again. Well, believe this,No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,Become them with one half so good a graceAs mercy does.If he had been as you and you as he,You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,Would not have been so stern.ANGELOPray you, be gone.ISABELLAI would to heaven I had your potency,And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,And what a prisoner.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]Ay, touch him; there's the vein.ANGELOYour brother is a forfeit of the law,And you but waste your words.ISABELLAAlas, alas!Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;And He that might the vantage best have tookFound out the remedy. How would you be,If He, which is the top of judgment, shouldBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;And mercy then will breathe within your lips,Like man new made.ANGELOBe you content, fair maid;It is the law, not I condemn your brother:Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.ISABELLATo-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchensWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heavenWith less respect than we do ministerTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;Who is it that hath died for this offence?There's many have committed it.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.ANGELOThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:Those many had not dared to do that evil,If the first that did the edict infringeHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awakeTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,Are now to have no successive degrees,But, ere they live, to end.ISABELLAYet show some pity.ANGELOI show it most of all when I show justice;For then I pity those I do not know,Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.ISABELLASo you must be the first that gives this sentence,And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellentTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannousTo use it like a giant.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.ISABELLACould great men thunderAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,For every pelting, petty officerWould use his heaven for thunder;Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oakThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,Drest in a little brief authority,Most ignorant of what he's most assured,His glassy essence, like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,Would all themselves laugh mortal.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! hewill relent;He's coming; I perceive 't.Provost[Aside] Pray heaven she win him!ISABELLAWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself:Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,But in the less foul profanation.LUCIOThou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.ISABELLAThat in the captain's but a choleric word,Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.ANGELOWhy do you put these sayings upon me?ISABELLABecause authority, though it err like others,Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth knowThat's like my brother's fault: if it confessA natural guiltiness such as is his,Let it not sound a thought upon your tongueAgainst my brother's life.ANGELO[Aside] She speaks, and 'tisSuch sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.ISABELLAGentle my lord, turn back.ANGELOI will bethink me: come again tomorrow.ISABELLAHark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.ANGELOHow! bribe me?ISABELLAAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.ISABELLANot with fond shekels of the tested gold,Or stones whose rates are either rich or poorAs fancy values them; but with true prayersThat shall be up at heaven and enter thereEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,From fasting maids whose minds are dedicateTo nothing temporal.ANGELOWell; come to me to-morrow.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!ISABELLAHeaven keep your honour safe!ANGELO[Aside]	Amen:For I am that way going to temptation,Where prayers cross.ISABELLAAt what hour to-morrowShall I attend your lordship?ANGELOAt any time 'fore noon.ISABELLA'Save your honour!Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and ProvostANGELOFrom thee, even from thy virtue!What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?Ha!Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is IThat, lying by the violet in the sun,Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it beThat modesty may more betray our senseThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,Shall we desire to raze the sanctuaryAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?Dost thou desire her foully for those thingsThat make her good? O, let her brother live!Thieves for their robbery have authorityWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,That I desire to hear her speak again,And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerousIs that temptation that doth goad us onTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,With all her double vigour, art and nature,Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maidSubdues me quite. Even till now,When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.ExitSCENE III. A room in a prison.Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOHail to you, provost! so I think you are.ProvostI am the provost. What's your will, good friar?DUKE VINCENTIOBound by my charity and my blest order,I come to visit the afflicted spiritsHere in the prison. Do me the common rightTo let me see them and to make me knowThe nature of their crimes, that I may ministerTo them accordingly.ProvostI would do more than that, if more were needful.Enter JULIETLook, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;And he that got it, sentenced; a young manMore fit to do another such offenceThan die for this.DUKE VINCENTIOWhen must he die?ProvostAs I do think, to-morrow.I have provided for you: stay awhile,To JULIETAnd you shall be conducted.DUKE VINCENTIORepent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?JULIETI do; and bear the shame most patiently.DUKE VINCENTIOI'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,And try your penitence, if it be sound,Or hollowly put on.JULIETI'll gladly learn.DUKE VINCENTIOLove you the man that wrong'd you?JULIETYes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.DUKE VINCENTIOSo then it seems your most offenceful actWas mutually committed?JULIETMutually.DUKE VINCENTIOThen was your sin of heavier kind than his.JULIETI do confess it, and repent it, father.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,But as we stand in fear,--JULIETI do repent me, as it is an evil,And take the shame with joy.DUKE VINCENTIOThere rest.Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,And I am going with instruction to him.Grace go with you, Benedicite!ExitJULIETMust die to-morrow! O injurious love,That respites me a life, whose very comfortIs still a dying horror!Provost'Tis pity of him.ExeuntSCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELOANGELOWhen I would pray and think, I think and prayTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,As if I did but only chew his name;And in my heart the strong and swelling evilOf my conception. The state, whereon I studiedIs like a good thing, being often read,Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,Could I with boot change for an idle plume,Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:'Tis not the devil's crest.Enter a ServantHow now! who's there?ServantOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.ANGELOTeach her the way.Exit ServantO heavens!Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,Making both it unable for itself,And dispossessing all my other partsOf necessary fitness?So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;Come all to help him, and so stop the airBy which he should revive: and even soThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnessCrowd to his presence, where their untaught loveMust needs appear offence.Enter ISABELLAHow now, fair maid?ISABELLAI am come to know your pleasure.ANGELOThat you might know it, would much better please meThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.ISABELLAEven so. Heaven keep your honour!ANGELOYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,As long as you or Iyet he must die.ISABELLAUnder your sentence?ANGELOYea.ISABELLAWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,Longer or shorter, he may be so fittedThat his soul sicken not.ANGELOHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as goodTo pardon him that hath from nature stolenA man already made, as to remitTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's imageIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easyFalsely to take away a life true madeAs to put metal in restrained meansTo make a false one.ISABELLA'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.ANGELOSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain'd?ISABELLASir, believe this,I had rather give my body than my soul.ANGELOI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sinsStand more for number than for accompt.ISABELLAHow say you?ANGELONay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speakAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:I, now the voice of the recorded law,Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:Might there not be a charity in sinTo save this brother's life?ISABELLAPlease you to do't,I'll take it as a peril to my soul,It is no sin at all, but charity.ANGELOPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,Were equal poise of sin and charity.ISABELLAThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayerTo have it added to the faults of mine,And nothing of your answer.ANGELONay, but hear me.Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.ISABELLALet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,But graciously to know I am no better.ANGELOThus wisdom wishes to appear most brightWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:Your brother is to die.ISABELLASo.ANGELOAnd his offence is so, as it appears,Accountant to the law upon that pain.ISABELLATrue.ANGELOAdmit no other way to save his life,--As I subscribe not that, nor any other,But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,Finding yourself desired of such a person,Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,Could fetch your brother from the manaclesOf the all-building law; and that there wereNo earthly mean to save him, but that eitherYou must lay down the treasures of your bodyTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;What would you do?ISABELLAAs much for my poor brother as myself:That is, were I under the terms of death,The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,And strip myself to death, as to a bedThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yieldMy body up to shame.ANGELOThen must your brother die.ISABELLAAnd 'twere the cheaper way:Better it were a brother died at once,Than that a sister, by redeeming him,Should die for ever.ANGELOWere not you then as cruel as the sentenceThat you have slander'd so?ISABELLAIgnomy in ransom and free pardonAre of two houses: lawful mercyIs nothing kin to foul redemption.ANGELOYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;And rather proved the sliding of your brotherA merriment than a vice.ISABELLAO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:I something do excuse the thing I hate,For his advantage that I dearly love.ANGELOWe are all frail.ISABELLAElse let my brother die,If not a feodary, but only heOwe and succeed thy weakness.ANGELONay, women are frail too.ISABELLAAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;Which are as easy broke as they make forms.Women! Help Heaven! men their creation marIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;For we are soft as our complexions are,And credulous to false prints.ANGELOI think it well:And from this testimony of your own sex,--Since I suppose we are made to be no strongerThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;I do arrest your words. Be that you are,That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;If you be one, as you are well express'dBy all external warrants, show it now,By putting on the destined livery.ISABELLAI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,Let me entreat you speak the former language.ANGELOPlainly conceive, I love you.ISABELLAMy brother did love Juliet,And you tell me that he shall die for it.ANGELOHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.ISABELLAI know your virtue hath a licence in't,Which seems a little fouler than it is,To pluck on others.ANGELOBelieve me, on mine honour,My words express my purpose.ISABELLAHa! little honour to be much believed,And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:Sign me a present pardon for my brother,Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloudWhat man thou art.ANGELOWho will believe thee, Isabel?My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,Will so your accusation overweigh,That you shall stifle in your own reportAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,And now I give my sensual race the rein:Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherBy yielding up thy body to my will;Or else he must not only die the death,But thy unkindness shall his death draw outTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,Or, by the affection that now guides me most,I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.ExitISABELLATo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,Either of condemnation or approof;Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.That, had he twenty heads to tender downOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,Before his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr'd pollution.Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:More than our brother is our chastity.I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.ExitACT IIISCENE I. A room in the prison.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?CLAUDIOThe miserable have no other medicineBut only hope:I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.DUKE VINCENTIOBe absolute for death; either death or lifeShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:If I do lose thee, I do lose a thingThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,Servile to all the skyey influences,That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shunAnd yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;For all the accommodations that thou bear'stAre nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;For thou dost fear the soft and tender forkOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'stThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;For thou exist'st on many a thousand grainsThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,The mere effusion of thy proper loins,Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youthBecomes as aged, and doth beg the almsOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in thisThat bears the name of life? Yet in this lifeLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,That makes these odds all even.CLAUDIOI humbly thank you.To sue to live, I find I seek to die;And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.ISABELLA[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!ProvostWho's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.DUKE VINCENTIODear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.CLAUDIOMost holy sir, I thank you.Enter ISABELLAISABELLAMy business is a word or two with Claudio.ProvostAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.DUKE VINCENTIOProvost, a word with you.ProvostAs many as you please.DUKE VINCENTIOBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and ProvostCLAUDIONow, sister, what's the comfort?ISABELLAWhy,As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,Intends you for his swift ambassador,Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:Therefore your best appointment make with speed;To-morrow you set on.CLAUDIOIs there no remedy?ISABELLANone, but such remedy as, to save a head,To cleave a heart in twain.CLAUDIOBut is there any?ISABELLAYes, brother, you may live:There is a devilish mercy in the judge,If you'll implore it, that will free your life,But fetter you till death.CLAUDIOPerpetual durance?ISABELLAAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,Though all the world's vastidity you had,To a determined scope.CLAUDIOBut in what nature?ISABELLAIn such a one as, you consenting to't,Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,And leave you naked.CLAUDIOLet me know the point.ISABELLAO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,And six or seven winters more respectThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?The sense of death is most in apprehension;And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,In corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatAs when a giant dies.CLAUDIOWhy give you me this shame?Think you I can a resolution fetchFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,I will encounter darkness as a bride,And hug it in mine arms.ISABELLAThere spake my brother; there my father's graveDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:Thou art too noble to conserve a lifeIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,Whose settled visage and deliberate wordNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmewAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devilHis filth within being cast, he would appearA pond as deep as hell.CLAUDIOThe prenzie Angelo!ISABELLAO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,The damned'st body to invest and coverIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?If I would yield him my virginity,Thou mightst be freed.CLAUDIOO heavens! it cannot be.ISABELLAYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,So to offend him still. This night's the timeThat I should do what I abhor to name,Or else thou diest to-morrow.CLAUDIOThou shalt not do't.ISABELLAO, were it but my life,I'ld throw it down for your deliveranceAs frankly as a pin.CLAUDIOThanks, dear Isabel.ISABELLABe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.CLAUDIOYes. Has he affections in him,That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.ISABELLAWhich is the least?CLAUDIOIf it were damnable, he being so wise,Why would he for the momentary trickBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!ISABELLAWhat says my brother?CLAUDIODeath is a fearful thing.ISABELLAAnd shamed life a hateful.CLAUDIOAy, but to die, and go we know not where;To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;This sensible warm motion to becomeA kneaded clod; and the delighted spiritTo bathe in fiery floods, or to resideIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,And blown with restless violence round aboutThe pendent world; or to be worse than worstOf those that lawless and incertain thoughtImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!The weariest and most loathed worldly lifeThat age, ache, penury and imprisonmentCan lay on nature is a paradiseTo what we fear of death.ISABELLAAlas, alas!CLAUDIOSweet sister, let me live:What sin you do to save a brother's life,Nature dispenses with the deed so farThat it becomes a virtue.ISABELLAO you beast!O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?Is't not a kind of incest, to take lifeFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!For such a warped slip of wildernessNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!Die, perish! Might but my bending downReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,No word to save thee.CLAUDIONay, hear me, Isabel.ISABELLAO, fie, fie, fie!Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:'Tis best thou diest quickly.CLAUDIOO hear me, Isabella!Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIODUKE VINCENTIOVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.ISABELLAWhat is your will?DUKE VINCENTIOMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by andby have some speech with you: the satisfaction Iwould require is likewise your own benefit.ISABELLAI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must bestolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.Walks apartDUKE VINCENTIOSon, I have overheard what hath passed between youand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose tocorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of hervirtue to practise his judgment with the dispositionof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,hath made him that gracious denial which he is mostglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and Iknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself todeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopesthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go toyour knees and make ready.CLAUDIOLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of lovewith life that I will sue to be rid of it.DUKE VINCENTIOHold you there: farewell.Exit CLAUDIOProvost, a word with you!Re-enter ProvostProvostWhat's your will, fatherDUKE VINCENTIOThat now you are come, you will be gone. Leave meawhile with the maid: my mind promises with myhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.ProvostIn good time.Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forwardDUKE VINCENTIOThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beautybrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul ofyour complexion, shall keep the body of it everfair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, butthat frailty hath examples for his falling, I shouldwonder at Angelo. How will you do to content thissubstitute, and to save your brother?ISABELLAI am now going to resolve him: I had rather mybrother die by the law than my son should beunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good dukedeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I canspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, ordiscover his government.DUKE VINCENTIOThat shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matternow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he madetrial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on myadvisings: to the love I have in doing good aremedy presents itself. I do make myself believethat you may most uprighteously do a poor wrongedlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother fromthe angry law; do no stain to your own graciousperson; and much please the absent duke, ifperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing ofthis business.ISABELLALet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to doanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.DUKE VINCENTIOVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Haveyou not heard speak of Mariana, the sister ofFrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?ISABELLAI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.DUKE VINCENTIOShe should this Angelo have married; was affiancedto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: betweenwhich time of the contract and limit of thesolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,having in that perished vessel the dowry of hissister. But mark how heavily this befell to thepoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble andrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever mostkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew ofher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, hercombinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.ISABELLACan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?DUKE VINCENTIOLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of themwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yetwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,is washed with them, but relents not.ISABELLAWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maidfrom the world! What corruption in this life, thatit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?DUKE VINCENTIOIt is a rupture that you may easily heal: and thecure of it not only saves your brother, but keepsyou from dishonour in doing it.ISABELLAShow me how, good father.DUKE VINCENTIOThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuanceof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, thatin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,like an impediment in the current, made it moreviolent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer hisrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree withhis demands to the point; only refer yourself tothis advantage, first, that your stay with him maynot be long; that the time may have all shadow andsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.This being granted in course,--and now followsall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead upyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounteracknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him toher recompense: and here, by this, is your brothersaved, your honour untainted, the poor Marianaadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maidwill I frame and make fit for his attempt. If youthink well to carry this as you may, the doublenessof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.What think you of it?ISABELLAThe image of it gives me content already; and Itrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.DUKE VINCENTIOIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedilyto Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to hisbed, give him promise of satisfaction. I willpresently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moatedgrange, resides this dejected Mariana. At thatplace call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, thatit may be quickly.ISABELLAI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.Exeunt severallySCENE II.

'Bless you, good father friar.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd you, good brother father. What offence haththis man made you, sir?ELBOWMarry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, wetake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have foundupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we havesent to the deputy.DUKE VINCENTIOFie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!The evil that thou causest to be done,That is thy means to live. Do thou but thinkWhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a backFrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,From their abominable and beastly touchesI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.Canst thou believe thy living is a life,So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.POMPEYIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,sir, I would prove--DUKE VINCENTIONay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:Correction and instruction must both workEre this rude beast will profit.ELBOWHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given himwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: ifhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he wereas good go a mile on his errand.DUKE VINCENTIOThat we were all, as some would seem to be,From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!ELBOWHis neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.POMPEYI spy comfort; I cry bail.

For debt, Pompey? or how?ELBOWFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.LUCIOWell, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be thedue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is hedoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; youwill keep the house.POMPEYI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.LUCIONo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: Ifyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is themore.

'Bless you, friar.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd you.LUCIODoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?ELBOWCome your ways, sir; come.POMPEYYou will not bail me, then, sir?LUCIOThen, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?what news?ELBOWCome your ways, sir; come.LUCIOGo to kennel, Pompey; go.Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and OfficersWhat news, friar, of the duke?DUKE VINCENTIOI know none. Can you tell me of any?LUCIOSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; othersome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?DUKE VINCENTIOI know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.LUCIOIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal fromthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never bornto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; heputs transgression to 't.DUKE VINCENTIOHe does well in 't.LUCIOA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm inhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.LUCIOYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirpit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putdown. They say this Angelo was not made by man andwoman after this downright way of creation: is ittrue, think you?DUKE VINCENTIOHow should he be made, then?LUCIOSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that hewas begot between two stock-fishes. But it iscertain that when he makes water his urine iscongealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is amotion generative; that's infallible.DUKE VINCENTIOYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.LUCIOWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for therebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of aman! Would the duke that is absent have done this?Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting ahundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursinga thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: heknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.DUKE VINCENTIOI never heard the absent duke much detected forwomen; he was not inclined that way.LUCIOO, sir, you are deceived.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis not possible.LUCIOWho, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; andhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: theduke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;that let me inform you.DUKE VINCENTIOYou do him wrong, surely.LUCIOSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was theduke: and I believe I know the cause of hiswithdrawing.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?LUCIONo, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within theteeth and the lips: but this I can let youunderstand, the greater file of the subject held theduke to be wise.DUKE VINCENTIOWise! why, no question but he was.LUCIOA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.DUKE VINCENTIOEither this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:the very stream of his life and the business he hathhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a betterproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his ownbringings-forth, and he shall appear to theenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if yourknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.LUCIOSir, I know him, and I love him.DUKE VINCENTIOLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge withdearer love.LUCIOCome, sir, I know what I know.DUKE VINCENTIOI can hardly believe that, since you know not whatyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as ourprayers are he may, let me desire you to make youranswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to callupon you; and, I pray you, your name?LUCIOSir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.DUKE VINCENTIOHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live toreport you.LUCIOI fear you not.DUKE VINCENTIOO, you hope the duke will return no more; or youimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed Ican do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.LUCIOI'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell ifClaudio die to-morrow or no?DUKE VINCENTIOWhy should he die, sir?LUCIOWhy? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I wouldthe duke we talk of were returned again: theungenitured agent will unpeople the province withcontinency; sparrows must not build in hishouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The dukeyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he wouldnever bring them to light: would he were returned!Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. Theduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton onFridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brownbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.ExitDUKE VINCENTIONo might nor greatness in mortalityCan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumnyThe whitest virtue strikes.

There is scarcetruth enough alive to make societies secure; butsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: muchupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. Thisnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. Ipray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?ESCALUSOne that, above all other strifes, contendedespecially to know himself.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat pleasure was he given to?ESCALUSRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry atany thing which professed to make him rejoice: agentleman of all temperance. But leave we him tohis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;and let me desire to know how you find Claudioprepared. I am made to understand that you havelent him visitation.DUKE VINCENTIOHe professes to have received no sinister measurefrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himselfto the determination of justice: yet had he framedto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, manydeceiving promises of life; which I by my goodleisure have discredited to him, and now is heresolved to die.ESCALUSYou have paid the heavens your function, and theprisoner the very debt of your calling. I havelaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremestshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have Ifound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell himhe is indeed Justice.DUKE VINCENTIOIf his own life answer the straitness of hisproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if hechance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.ESCALUSI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.DUKE VINCENTIOPeace be with you!Exeunt ESCALUS and ProvostHe who the sword of heaven will bearShould be as holy as severe;Pattern in himself to know,Grace to stand, and virtue go;More nor less to others payingThan by self-offences weighing.Shame to him whose cruel strikingKills for faults of his own liking!Twice treble shame on Angelo,To weed my vice and let his grow!O, what may man within him hide,Though angel on the outward side!How may likeness made in crimes,Making practise on the times,To draw with idle spiders' stringsMost ponderous and substantial things!Craft against vice I must apply:With Angelo to-night shall lieHis old betrothed but despised;So disguise shall, by the disguised,Pay with falsehood false exacting,And perform an old contracting.ExitACT IVSCENE I.

Can you cut off a man's head?POMPEYIf the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be amarried man, he's his wife's head, and I can nevercut off a woman's head.ProvostCome, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me adirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudioand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a commonexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: ifyou will take it on you to assist him, it shallredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall haveyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverancewith an unpitied whipping, for you have been anotorious bawd.POMPEYSir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. Iwould be glad to receive some instruction from myfellow partner.ProvostWhat, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?Enter ABHORSONABHORSONDo you call, sir?ProvostSirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow inyour execution. If you think it meet, compound withhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; ifnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. Hecannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.ABHORSONA bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.ProvostGo to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turnthe scale.ExitPOMPEYPray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, agood favour you have, but that you have a hanginglook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?ABHORSONAy, sir; a mysteryPOMPEYPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; andyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:but what mystery there should be in hanging, if Ishould be hanged, I cannot imagine.ABHORSONSir, it is a mystery.POMPEYProof?ABHORSONEvery true man's apparel fits your thief: if it betoo little for your thief, your true man thinks itbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, yourthief thinks it little enough: so every true man'sapparel fits your thief.Re-enter ProvostProvostAre you agreed?POMPEYSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman isa more penitent trade than your bawd; he dothoftener ask forgiveness.ProvostYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axeto-morrow four o'clock.ABHORSONCome on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.POMPEYI do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you haveoccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall findme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe youa good turn.ProvostCall hither Barnardine and Claudio:Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSONThe one has my pity; not a jot the other,Being a murderer, though he were my brother.Enter CLAUDIOLook, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrowThou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?CLAUDIOAs fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labourWhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:He will not wake.ProvostWho can do good on him?Well, go, prepare yourself.Knocking withinBut, hark, what noise?Heaven give your spirits comfort!Exit CLAUDIOBy and by.I hope it is some pardon or reprieveFor the most gentle Claudio.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as beforeWelcome father.DUKE VINCENTIOThe best and wholesomest spirts of the nightEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?ProvostNone, since the curfew rung.DUKE VINCENTIONot Isabel?ProvostNo.DUKE VINCENTIOThey will, then, ere't be long.ProvostWhat comfort is for Claudio?DUKE VINCENTIOThere's some in hope.ProvostIt is a bitter deputy.DUKE VINCENTIONot so, not so; his life is parallel'dEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:He doth with holy abstinence subdueThat in himself which he spurs on his powerTo qualify in others: were he meal'd with thatWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;But this being so, he's just.Knocking withinNow are they come.Exit ProvostThis is a gentle provost: seldom whenThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.Knocking withinHow now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with hasteThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.Re-enter ProvostProvostThere he must stay until the officerArise to let him in: he is call'd up.DUKE VINCENTIOHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,But he must die to-morrow?ProvostNone, sir, none.DUKE VINCENTIOAs near the dawning, provost, as it is,You shall hear more ere morning.ProvostHappilyYou something know; yet I believe there comesNo countermand; no such example have we:Besides, upon the very siege of justiceLord Angelo hath to the public earProfess'd the contrary.Enter a MessengerThis is his lordship's man.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd here comes Claudio's pardon.Messenger[Giving a paper]My lord hath sent you this note; and by me thisfurther charge, that you swerve not from thesmallest article of it, neither in time, matter, orother circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,it is almost day.ProvostI shall obey him.Exit MessengerDUKE VINCENTIO[Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sinFor which the pardoner himself is in.Hence hath offence his quick celerity,When it is born in high authority:When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,That for the fault's love is the offender friended.Now, sir, what news?ProvostI told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remissin mine office, awakens me with this unwontedputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.DUKE VINCENTIOPray you, let's hear.Provost[Reads]'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, letClaudio be executed by four of the clock; and in theafternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Letthis be duly performed; with a thought that moredepends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus failnot to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'What say you to this, sir?DUKE VINCENTIOWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in theafternoon?ProvostA Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; onethat is a prisoner nine years old.DUKE VINCENTIOHow came it that the absent duke had not eitherdelivered him to his liberty or executed him? Ihave heard it was ever his manner to do so.ProvostHis friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,indeed, his fact, till now in the government of LordAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is now apparent?ProvostMost manifest, and not denied by himself.DUKE VINCENTIOHath he born himself penitently in prison? howseems he to be touched?ProvostA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully butas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearlessof what's past, present, or to come; insensible ofmortality, and desperately mortal.DUKE VINCENTIOHe wants advice.ProvostHe will hear none: he hath evermore had the libertyof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, hewould not: drunk many times a day, if not many daysentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as ifto carry him to execution, and showed him a seemingwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.DUKE VINCENTIOMore of him anon. There is written in your brow,provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it nottruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in theboldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, isno greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hathsentenced him. To make you understand this in amanifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;for the which you are to do me both a present and adangerous courtesy.ProvostPray, sir, in what?DUKE VINCENTIOIn the delaying death.ProvostA lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,and an express command, under penalty, to deliverhis head in the view of Angelo? I may make my caseas Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.DUKE VINCENTIOBy the vow of mine order I warrant you, if myinstructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardinebe this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.ProvostAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.DUKE VINCENTIOO, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it wasthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before hisdeath: you know the course is common. If any thingfall to you upon this, more than thanks and goodfortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will pleadagainst it with my life.ProvostPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.DUKE VINCENTIOWere you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?ProvostTo him, and to his substitutes.DUKE VINCENTIOYou will think you have made no offence, if the dukeavouch the justice of your dealing?ProvostBut what likelihood is in that?DUKE VINCENTIONot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I seeyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, norpersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will gofurther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of theduke: you know the character, I doubt not; and thesignet is not strange to you.ProvostI know them both.DUKE VINCENTIOThe contents of this is the return of the duke: youshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where youshall find, within these two days he will be here.This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he thisvery day receives letters of strange tenor;perchance of the duke's death; perchance enteringinto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of whatis writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up theshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how thesethings should be: all difficulties are but easywhen they are known. Call your executioner, and offwith Barnardine's head: I will give him a presentshrift and advise him for a better place. Yet youare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.Come away; it is almost clear dawn.ExeuntSCENE III. Another room in the same.Enter POMPEYPOMPEYI am as well acquainted here as I was in our houseof profession: one would think it were MistressOverdone's own house, for here be many of her oldcustomers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's infor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he madefive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was notmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit ofMaster Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits ofpeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him abeggar.

I am sleepy.ABHORSONTell him he must awake, and that quickly too.POMPEYPray, Master Barnardine, awake till you areexecuted, and sleep afterwards.ABHORSONGo in to him, and fetch him out.POMPEYHe is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.ABHORSONIs the axe upon the block, sirrah?POMPEYVery ready, sir.Enter BARNARDINEBARNARDINEHow now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?ABHORSONTruly, sir, I would desire you to clap into yourprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.BARNARDINEYou rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am notfitted for 't.POMPEYO, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep thesounder all the next day.ABHORSONLook you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: dowe jest now, think you?Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as beforeDUKE VINCENTIOSir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfortyou and pray with you.BARNARDINEFriar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,and I will have more time to prepare me, or theyshall beat out my brains with billets: I will notconsent to die this day, that's certain.DUKE VINCENTIOO, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech youLook forward on the journey you shall go.BARNARDINEI swear I will not die to-day for any man'spersuasion.DUKE VINCENTIOBut hear you.BARNARDINENot a word: if you have any thing to say to me,come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.ExitDUKE VINCENTIOUnfit to live or die: O gravel heart!After him, fellows; bring him to the block.Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEYRe-enter ProvostProvostNow, sir, how do you find the prisoner?DUKE VINCENTIOA creature unprepared, unmeet for death;And to transport him in the mind he isWere damnable.ProvostHere in the prison, father,There died this morning of a cruel feverOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,A man of Claudio's years; his beard and headJust of his colour. What if we do omitThis reprobate till he were well inclined;And satisfy the deputy with the visageOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?DUKE VINCENTIOO, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!Dispatch it presently; the hour draws onPrefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,And sent according to command; whiles IPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.ProvostThis shall be done, good father, presently.But Barnardine must die this afternoon:And how shall we continue Claudio,To save me from the danger that might comeIf he were known alive?DUKE VINCENTIOLet this be done.Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingTo the under generation, you shall findYour safety manifested.ProvostI am your free dependant.DUKE VINCENTIOQuick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.Exit ProvostNow will I write letters to Angelo,--The provost, he shall bear them, whose contentsShall witness to him I am near at home,And that, by great injunctions, I am boundTo enter publicly: him I'll desireTo meet me at the consecrated fountA league below the city; and from thence,By cold gradation and well-balanced form,We shall proceed with Angelo.Re-enter ProvostProvostHere is the head; I'll carry it myself.DUKE VINCENTIOConvenient is it.

She's come to knowIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:But I will keep her ignorant of her good,To make her heavenly comforts of despair,When it is least expected.Enter ISABELLAISABELLAHo, by your leave!DUKE VINCENTIOGood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.ISABELLAThe better, given me by so holy a man.Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?DUKE VINCENTIOHe hath released him, Isabel, from the world:His head is off and sent to Angelo.ISABELLANay, but it is not so.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,In your close patience.ISABELLAO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!DUKE VINCENTIOYou shall not be admitted to his sight.ISABELLAUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!Injurious world! most damned Angelo!DUKE VINCENTIOThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.Mark what I say, which you shall findBy every syllable a faithful verity:The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;One of our convent, and his confessor,Gives me this instance: already he hath carriedNotice to Escalus and Angelo,Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdomIn that good path that I would wish it go,And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,And general honour.ISABELLAI am directed by you.DUKE VINCENTIOThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:Say, by this token, I desire his companyAt Mariana's house to-night.

Friar, where's the provost?DUKE VINCENTIONot within, sir.LUCIOO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to 't. But they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.Exit ISABELLADUKE VINCENTIOSir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.LUCIOFriar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.DUKE VINCENTIOWell, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.LUCIONay, tarry; I'll go along with theeI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.DUKE VINCENTIOYou have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.LUCIOI was once before him for getting a wench with child.DUKE VINCENTIODid you such a thing?LUCIOYes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.DUKE VINCENTIOSir, your company is fairer than honest.

A room in ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELO and ESCALUSESCALUSEvery letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.ANGELOIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actionsshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, andredeliver our authorities thereESCALUSI guess not.ANGELOAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before hisentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,they should exhibit their petitions in the street?ESCALUSHe shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch ofcomplaints, and to deliver us from deviceshereafter, which shall then have no power to standagainst us.ANGELOWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimesi' the morn; I'll call you at your house: givenotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meethim.ESCALUSI shall, sir. Fare you well.ANGELOGood night.Exit ESCALUSThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnantAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!And by an eminent body that enforcedThe law against it! But that her tender shameWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;For my authority bears of a credent bulk,That no particular scandal once can touchBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,By so receiving a dishonour'd lifeWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.ExitSCENE V.

Give me your hand,And let the subject see, to make them knowThat outward courtesies would fain proclaimFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,You must walk by us on our other hand;And good supporters are you.FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forwardFRIAR PETERNow is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.ISABELLAJustice, O royal duke!

Hear me, O hear me, here!ANGELOMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:She hath been a suitor to me for her brotherCut off by course of justice,--ISABELLABy course of justice!ANGELOAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.ISABELLAMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?That Angelo is an adulterous thief,An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;Is it not strange and strange?DUKE VINCENTIONay, it is ten times strange.ISABELLAIt is not truer he is AngeloThan this is all as true as it is strange:Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truthTo the end of reckoning.DUKE VINCENTIOAway with her! Poor soul,She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.ISABELLAO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believestThere is another comfort than this world,That thou neglect me not, with that opinionThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossibleThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossibleBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absoluteAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,Had I more name for badness.DUKE VINCENTIOBy mine honesty,If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,Such a dependency of thing on thing,As e'er I heard in madness.ISABELLAO gracious duke,Harp not on that, nor do not banish reasonFor inequality; but let your reason serveTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,And hide the false seems true.DUKE VINCENTIOMany that are not madHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?ISABELLAI am the sister of one Claudio,Condemn'd upon the act of fornicationTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:I, in probation of a sisterhood,Was sent to by my brother; one LucioAs then the messenger,--LUCIOThat's I, an't like your grace:I came to her from Claudio, and desired herTo try her gracious fortune with Lord AngeloFor her poor brother's pardon.ISABELLAThat's he indeed.DUKE VINCENTIOYou were not bid to speak.LUCIONo, my good lord;Nor wish'd to hold my peace.DUKE VINCENTIOI wish you now, then;Pray you, take note of it: and when you haveA business for yourself, pray heaven you thenBe perfect.LUCIOI warrant your honour.DUKE VINCENTIOThe warrants for yourself; take heed to't.ISABELLAThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--LUCIORight.DUKE VINCENTIOIt may be right; but you are i' the wrongTo speak before your time. Proceed.ISABELLAI wentTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--DUKE VINCENTIOThat's somewhat madly spoken.ISABELLAPardon it;The phrase is to the matter.DUKE VINCENTIOMended again. The matter; proceed.ISABELLAIn brief, to set the needless process by,How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--For this was of much length,--the vile conclusionI now begin with grief and shame to utter:He would not, but by gift of my chaste bodyTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,Release my brother; and, after much debatement,My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrantFor my poor brother's head.DUKE VINCENTIOThis is most likely!ISABELLAO, that it were as like as it is true!DUKE VINCENTIOBy heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,Or else thou art suborn'd against his honourIn hateful practise. First, his integrityStands without blemish. Next, it imports no reasonThat with such vehemency he should pursueFaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,He would have weigh'd thy brother by himselfAnd not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:Confess the truth, and say by whose adviceThou camest here to complain.ISABELLAAnd is this all?Then, O you blessed ministers above,Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd timeUnfold the evil which is here wrapt upIn countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!DUKE VINCENTIOI know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!To prison with her! Shall we thus permitA blasting and a scandalous breath to fallOn him so near us? This needs must be a practise.Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?ISABELLAOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.DUKE VINCENTIOA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?LUCIOMy lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lordFor certain words he spake against your graceIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.DUKE VINCENTIOWords against me? this is a good friar, belike!And to set on this wretched woman hereAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.LUCIOBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,A very scurvy fellow.FRIAR PETERBlessed be your royal grace!I have stood by, my lord, and I have heardYour royal ear abused. First, hath this womanMost wrongfully accused your substitute,Who is as free from touch or soil with herAs she from one ungot.DUKE VINCENTIOWe did believe no less.Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?FRIAR PETERI know him for a man divine and holy;Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,As he's reported by this gentleman;And, on my trust, a man that never yetDid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.LUCIOMy lord, most villanously; believe it.FRIAR PETERWell, he in time may come to clear himself;But at this instant he is sick my lord,Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,Being come to knowledge that there was complaintIntended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth knowIs true and false; and what he with his oathAnd all probation will make up full clear,Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.To justify this worthy nobleman,So vulgarly and personally accused,Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,Till she herself confess it.DUKE VINCENTIOGood friar, let's hear it.ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forwardDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;In this I'll be impartial; be you judgeOf your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?First, let her show her face, and after speak.MARIANAPardon, my lord; I will not show my faceUntil my husband bid me.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat, are you married?MARIANANo, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOAre you a maid?MARIANANo, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOA widow, then?MARIANANeither, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?LUCIOMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them areneither maid, widow, nor wife.DUKE VINCENTIOSilence that fellow: I would he had some causeTo prattle for himself.LUCIOWell, my lord.MARIANAMy lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;And I confess besides I am no maid:I have known my husband; yet my husbandKnows not that ever he knew me.LUCIOHe was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.DUKE VINCENTIOFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!LUCIOWell, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.MARIANANow I come to't my lordShe that accuses him of fornication,In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,And charges him my lord, with such a timeWhen I'll depose I had him in mine armsWith all the effect of love.ANGELOCharges she more than me?MARIANANot that I know.DUKE VINCENTIONo? you say your husband.MARIANAWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.ANGELOThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.MARIANAMy husband bids me; now I will unmask.UnveilingThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the bodyThat took away the match from Isabel,And did supply thee at thy garden-houseIn her imagined person.DUKE VINCENTIOKnow you this woman?LUCIOCarnally, she says.DUKE VINCENTIOSirrah, no more!LUCIOEnough, my lord.ANGELOMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:And five years since there was some speech of marriageBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,Partly for that her promised proportionsCame short of composition, but in chiefFor that her reputation was disvaluedIn levity: since which time of five yearsI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,Upon my faith and honour.MARIANANoble prince,As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,I am affianced this man's wife as stronglyAs words could make up vows: and, my good lord,But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-houseHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,Let me in safety raise me from my kneesOr else for ever be confixed here,A marble monument!ANGELOI did but smile till now:Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justiceMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceiveThese poor informal women are no moreBut instruments of some more mightier memberThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,To find this practise out.DUKE VINCENTIOAy, with my heartAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,Though they would swear down each particular saint,Were testimonies against his worth and creditThat's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind painsTo find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.There is another friar that set them on;Let him be sent for.FRIAR PETERWould he were here, my lord! for he indeedHath set the women on to this complaint:Your provost knows the place where he abidesAnd he may fetch him.DUKE VINCENTIOGo do it instantly.Exit ProvostAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,Do with your injuries as seems you best,In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;But stir not you till you have well determinedUpon these slanderers.ESCALUSMy lord, we'll do it throughly.Exit DUKESignior Lucio, did not you say you knew thatFriar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?LUCIO'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothingbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke mostvillanous speeches of the duke.ESCALUSWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come andenforce them against him: we shall find this friar anotable fellow.LUCIOAs any in Vienna, on my word.ESCALUSCall that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.Exit an AttendantPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; youshall see how I'll handle her.LUCIONot better than he, by her own report.ESCALUSSay you?LUCIOMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,she'll be ashamed.ESCALUSI will go darkly to work with her.LUCIOThat's the way; for women are light at midnight.Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habitESCALUSCome on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies allthat you have said.LUCIOMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here withthe provost.ESCALUSIn very good time: speak not you to him till wecall upon you.LUCIOMum.ESCALUSCome, sir: did you set these women on to slanderLord Angelo? they have confessed you did.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis false.ESCALUSHow! know you where you are?DUKE VINCENTIORespect to your great place! and let the devilBe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.ESCALUSThe duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:Look you speak justly.DUKE VINCENTIOBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,Thus to retort your manifest appeal,And put your trial in the villain's mouthWhich here you come to accuse.LUCIOThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.ESCALUSWhy, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these womenTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouthAnd in the witness of his proper ear,To call him villain? and then to glance from himTo the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse youJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.What 'unjust'!DUKE VINCENTIOBe not so hot; the dukeDare no more stretch this finger of mine than heDare rack his own: his subject am I not,Nor here provincial. My business in this stateMade me a looker on here in Vienna,Where I have seen corruption boil and bubbleTill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutesStand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,As much in mock as mark.ESCALUSSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!ANGELOWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?Is this the man that you did tell us of?LUCIO'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:do you know me?DUKE VINCENTIOI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: Imet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.LUCIOO, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?DUKE VINCENTIOMost notedly, sir.LUCIODo you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, afool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?DUKE VINCENTIOYou must, sir, change persons with me, ere you makethat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; andmuch more, much worse.LUCIOO thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by thenose for thy speeches?DUKE VINCENTIOI protest I love the duke as I love myself.ANGELOHark, how the villain would close now, after histreasonable abuses!ESCALUSSuch a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away withhim to prison! Where is the provost? Away with himto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let himspeak no more. Away with those giglots too, andwith the other confederate companion!DUKE VINCENTIO[To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.ANGELOWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.LUCIOCome, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, youbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, mustyou? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!Will't not off?Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIODUKE VINCENTIOThou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.To LUCIOSneak not away, sir; for the friar and youMust have a word anon. Lay hold on him.LUCIOThis may prove worse than hanging.DUKE VINCENTIO[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:We'll borrow place of him.To ANGELOSir, by your leave.Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,Rely upon it till my tale be heard,And hold no longer out.ANGELOO my dread lord,I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,To think I can be undiscernible,When I perceive your grace, like power divine,Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,No longer session hold upon my shame,But let my trial be mine own confession:Immediate sentence then and sequent deathIs all the grace I beg.DUKE VINCENTIOCome hither, Mariana.Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?ANGELOI was, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOGo take her hence, and marry her instantly.Do you the office, friar; which consummate,Return him here again. Go with him, provost.Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and ProvostESCALUSMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonourThan at the strangeness of it.DUKE VINCENTIOCome hither, Isabel.Your friar is now your prince: as I was thenAdvertising and holy to your business,Not changing heart with habit, I am stillAttorney'd at your service.ISABELLAO, give me pardon,That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'dYour unknown sovereignty!DUKE VINCENTIOYou are pardon'd, Isabel:And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;And you may marvel why I obscured myself,Labouring to save his life, and would not ratherMake rash remonstrance of my hidden powerThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,It was the swift celerity of his death,Which I did think with slower foot came on,That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!That life is better life, past fearing death,Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,So happy is your brother.ISABELLAI do, my lord.Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOFor this new-married man approaching here,Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'dYour well defended honour, you must pardonFor Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--Being criminal, in double violationOf sacred chastity and of promise-breachThereon dependent, for your brother's life,--The very mercy of the law cries outMost audible, even from his proper tongue,'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.We do condemn thee to the very blockWhere Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.Away with him!MARIANAO my most gracious lord,I hope you will not mock me with a husband.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is your husband mock'd you with a husband.Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,For that he knew you, might reproach your lifeAnd choke your good to come; for his possessions,Although by confiscation they are ours,We do instate and widow you withal,To buy you a better husband.MARIANAO my dear lord,I crave no other, nor no better man.DUKE VINCENTIONever crave him; we are definitive.MARIANAGentle my liege,--KneelingDUKE VINCENTIOYou do but lose your labour.Away with him to death!To LUCIONow, sir, to you.MARIANAO my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;Lend me your knees, and all my life to comeI'll lend you all my life to do you service.DUKE VINCENTIOAgainst all sense you do importune her:Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,And take her hence in horror.MARIANAIsabel,Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.They say, best men are moulded out of faults;And, for the most, become much more the betterFor being a little bad: so may my husband.O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?DUKE VINCENTIOHe dies for Claudio's death.ISABELLAMost bounteous sir,KneelingLook, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,As if my brother lived: I partly thinkA due sincerity govern'd his deeds,Till he did look on me: since it is so,Let him not die. My brother had but justice,In that he did the thing for which he died:For Angelo,His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,And must be buried but as an intentThat perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;Intents but merely thoughts.MARIANAMerely, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOYour suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.I have bethought me of another fault.Provost, how came it Claudio was beheadedAt an unusual hour?ProvostIt was commanded so.DUKE VINCENTIOHad you a special warrant for the deed?ProvostNo, my good lord; it was by private message.DUKE VINCENTIOFor which I do discharge you of your office:Give up your keys.ProvostPardon me, noble lord:I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;Yet did repent me, after more advice;For testimony whereof, one in the prison,That should by private order else have died,I have reserved alive.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat's he?ProvostHis name is Barnardine.DUKE VINCENTIOI would thou hadst done so by Claudio.Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.Exit ProvostESCALUSI am sorry, one so learned and so wiseAs you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.ANGELOI am sorry that such sorrow I procure:And so deep sticks it in my penitent heartThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIETDUKE VINCENTIOWhich is that Barnardine?ProvostThis, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOThere was a friar told me of this man.Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.That apprehends no further than this world,And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;And pray thee take this mercy to provideFor better times to come. Friar, advise him;I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?ProvostThis is another prisoner that I saved.Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;As like almost to Claudio as himself.Unmuffles CLAUDIODUKE VINCENTIO[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sakeIs he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,Give me your hand and say you will be mine.He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.I find an apt remission in myself;And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.To LUCIOYou, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;Wherein have I so deserved of you,That you extol me thus?LUCIO'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to thetrick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but Ihad rather it would please you I might be whipt.DUKE VINCENTIOWhipt first, sir, and hanged after.Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,As I have heard him swear himself there's oneWhom he begot with child, let her appear,And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,Let him be whipt and hang'd.LUCIOI beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.DUKE VINCENTIOUpon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithalRemit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;And see our pleasure herein executed.LUCIOMarrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,whipping, and hanging.DUKE VINCENTIOSlandering a prince deserves it.Exit Officers with LUCIOShe, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:There's more behind that is more gratulate.Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:We shill employ thee in a worthier place.Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you homeThe head of Ragozine for Claudio's:The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,I have a motion much imports your good;Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.So, bring us to our palace; where we'll showWhat's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.ExeuntACT ISCENE I.

Enough; no more:'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,That, notwithstanding thy capacityReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,Of what validity and pitch soe'er,But falls into abatement and low price,Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancyThat it alone is high fantastical.CURIOWill you go hunt, my lord?DUKE ORSINOWhat, Curio?CURIOThe hart.DUKE ORSINOWhy, so I do, the noblest that I have:O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,Methought she purged the air of pestilence!That instant was I turn'd into a hart;And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,E'er since pursue me.Enter VALENTINEHow now! what news from her?VALENTINESo please my lord, I might not be admitted;But from her handmaid do return this answer:The element itself, till seven years' heat,Shall not behold her face at ample view;But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walkAnd water once a day her chamber roundWith eye-offending brine: all this to seasonA brother's dead love, which she would keep freshAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.DUKE ORSINOO, she that hath a heart of that fine frameTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,How will she love, when the rich golden shaftHath kill'd the flock of all affections elseThat live in her; when liver, brain and heart,These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'dHer sweet perfections with one self king!Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.ExeuntSCENE II.

Know'st thou this country?CaptainAy, madam, well; for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.VIOLAWho governs here?CaptainA noble duke, in nature as in name.VIOLAWhat is the name?CaptainOrsino.VIOLAOrsino! I have heard my father name him:He was a bachelor then.CaptainAnd so is now, or was so very late;For but a month ago I went from hence,And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,What great ones do the less will prattle of,--That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.VIOLAWhat's she?CaptainA virtuous maid, the daughter of a countThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving herIn the protection of his son, her brother,Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,They say, she hath abjured the companyAnd sight of men.VIOLAO that I served that ladyAnd might not be delivered to the world,Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,What my estate is!CaptainThat were hard to compass;Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke's.VIOLAThere is a fair behavior in thee, captain;And though that nature with a beauteous wallDoth oft close in pollution, yet of theeI will believe thou hast a mind that suitsWith this thy fair and outward character.I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,Conceal me what I am, and be my aidFor such disguise as haply shall becomeThe form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:It may be worth thy pains; for I can singAnd speak to him in many sorts of musicThat will allow me very worth his service.What else may hap to time I will commit;Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.CaptainBe you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.VIOLAI thank thee: lead me on.ExeuntSCENE III.

I am a fellow o' thestrangest mind i' the world; I delight in masquesand revels sometimes altogether.SIR TOBY BELCHArt thou good at these kickshawses, knight?SIR ANDREWAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under thedegree of my betters; and yet I will not comparewith an old man.SIR TOBY BELCHWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?SIR ANDREWFaith, I can cut a caper.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd I can cut the mutton to't.SIR ANDREWAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strongas any man in Illyria.SIR TOBY BELCHWherefore are these things hid? wherefore havethese gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like totake dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dostthou not go to church in a galliard and come home ina coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would notso much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. Whatdost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?I did think, by the excellent constitution of thyleg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.SIR ANDREWAy, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in aflame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?SIR TOBY BELCHWhat shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?SIR ANDREWTaurus! That's sides and heart.SIR TOBY BELCHNo, sir; it is legs and thighs.

DUKE ORSINO's palace.Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attireVALENTINEIf the duke continue these favours towards you,Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hathknown you but three days, and already you are no stranger.VIOLAYou either fear his humour or my negligence, thatyou call in question the continuance of his love:is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?VALENTINENo, believe me.VIOLAI thank you. Here comes the count.Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and AttendantsDUKE ORSINOWho saw Cesario, ho?VIOLAOn your attendance, my lord; here.DUKE ORSINOStand you a while aloof, Cesario,Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'dTo thee the book even of my secret soul:Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;Be not denied access, stand at her doors,And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall growTill thou have audience.VIOLASure, my noble lord,If she be so abandon'd to her sorrowAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.DUKE ORSINOBe clamorous and leap all civil boundsRather than make unprofited return.VIOLASay I do speak with her, my lord, what then?DUKE ORSINOO, then unfold the passion of my love,Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:It shall become thee well to act my woes;She will attend it better in thy youthThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.VIOLAI think not so, my lord.DUKE ORSINODear lad, believe it;For they shall yet belie thy happy years,That say thou art a man: Diana's lipIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipeIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,And all is semblative a woman's part.I know thy constellation is right aptFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;All, if you will; for I myself am bestWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,To call his fortunes thine.VIOLAI'll do my bestTo woo your lady:Asideyet, a barful strife!Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.ExeuntSCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.Enter MARIA and ClownMARIANay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I willnot open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter inway of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.ClownLet her hang me: he that is well hanged in thisworld needs to fear no colours.MARIAMake that good.ClownHe shall see none to fear.MARIAA good lenten answer: I can tell thee where thatsaying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'ClownWhere, good Mistress Mary?MARIAIn the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.ClownWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and thosethat are fools, let them use their talents.MARIAYet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?ClownMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,for turning away, let summer bear it out.MARIAYou are resolute, then?ClownNot so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.MARIAThat if one break, the other will hold; or, if bothbreak, your gaskins fall.ClownApt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; ifSir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty apiece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.MARIAPeace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes mylady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.ExitClownWit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oftprove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, maypass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIOGod bless thee, lady!OLIVIATake the fool away.ClownDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.OLIVIAGo to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:besides, you grow dishonest.ClownTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counselwill amend: for give the dry fool drink, then isthe fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mendhimself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; ifhe cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thingthat's mended is but patched: virtue thattransgresses is but patched with sin; and sin thatamends is but patched with virtue. If that thissimple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,what remedy? As there is no true cuckold butcalamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade takeaway the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.OLIVIASir, I bade them take away you.ClownMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus nonfacit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear notmotley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave toprove you a fool.OLIVIACan you do it?ClownDexterously, good madonna.OLIVIAMake your proof.ClownI must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouseof virtue, answer me.OLIVIAWell, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.ClownGood madonna, why mournest thou?OLIVIAGood fool, for my brother's death.ClownI think his soul is in hell, madonna.OLIVIAI know his soul is in heaven, fool.ClownThe more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother'ssoul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.OLIVIAWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?MALVOLIOYes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make thebetter fool.ClownGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for thebetter increasing your folly! Sir Toby will besworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass hisword for two pence that you are no fool.OLIVIAHow say you to that, Malvolio?MALVOLIOI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such abarren rascal: I saw him put down the other daywith an ordinary fool that has no more brainthan a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guardalready; unless you laugh and minister occasion tohim, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,that crow so at these set kind of fools, no betterthan the fools' zanies.OLIVIAOh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and tastewith a distempered appetite. To be generous,guiltless and of free disposition, is to take thosethings for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he donothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreetman, though he do nothing but reprove.ClownNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thouspeakest well of fools!Re-enter MARIAMARIAMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman muchdesires to speak with you.OLIVIAFrom the Count Orsino, is it?MARIAI know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.OLIVIAWho of my people hold him in delay?MARIASir Toby, madam, your kinsman.OLIVIAFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing butmadman: fie on him!Exit MARIAGo you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, Iam sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.Exit MALVOLIONow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, andpeople dislike it.ClownThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldestson should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram withbrains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has amost weak pia mater.Enter SIR TOBY BELCHOLIVIABy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?SIR TOBY BELCHA gentleman.OLIVIAA gentleman! what gentleman?SIR TOBY BELCH'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' thesepickle-herring! How now, sot!ClownGood Sir Toby!OLIVIACousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?SIR TOBY BELCHLechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.OLIVIAAy, marry, what is he?SIR TOBY BELCHLet him be the devil, an he will, I care not: giveme faith, say I. Well, it's all one.ExitOLIVIAWhat's a drunken man like, fool?ClownLike a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: onedraught above heat makes him a fool; the second madshim; and a third drowns him.OLIVIAGo thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' mycoz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he'sdrowned: go, look after him.ClownHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall lookto the madman.ExitRe-enter MALVOLIOMALVOLIOMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak withyou. I told him you were sick; he takes on him tounderstand so much, and therefore comes to speakwith you. I told him you were asleep; he seems tohave a foreknowledge of that too, and thereforecomes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,lady? he's fortified against any denial.OLIVIATell him he shall not speak with me.MALVOLIOHas been told so; and he says, he'll stand at yourdoor like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter toa bench, but he'll speak with you.OLIVIAWhat kind o' man is he?MALVOLIOWhy, of mankind.OLIVIAWhat manner of man?MALVOLIOOf very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.OLIVIAOf what personage and years is he?MALVOLIONot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough fora boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or acooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with himin standing water, between boy and man. He is verywell-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; onewould think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.OLIVIALet him approach: call in my gentlewoman.MALVOLIOGentlewoman, my lady calls.ExitRe-enter MARIAOLIVIAGive me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.Enter VIOLA, and AttendantsVIOLAThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?OLIVIASpeak to me; I shall answer for her.Your will?VIOLAMost radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--Ipray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast awaymy speech, for besides that it is excellently wellpenned, I have taken great pains to con it. Goodbeauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am verycomptible, even to the least sinister usage.OLIVIAWhence came you, sir?VIOLAI can say little more than I have studied, and thatquestion's out of my part. Good gentle one, give memodest assurance if you be the lady of the house,that I may proceed in my speech.OLIVIAAre you a comedian?VIOLANo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangsof malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are youthe lady of the house?OLIVIAIf I do not usurp myself, I am.VIOLAMost certain, if you are she, you do usurpyourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yoursto reserve. But this is from my commission: I willon with my speech in your praise, and then show youthe heart of my message.OLIVIACome to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.VIOLAAlas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.OLIVIAIt is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,and allowed your approach rather to wonder at youthan to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; ifyou have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time ofmoon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.MARIAWill you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.VIOLANo, good swabber; I am to hull here a littlelonger. Some mollification for your giant, sweetlady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.OLIVIASure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, whenthe courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.VIOLAIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture ofwar, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in myhand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.OLIVIAYet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?VIOLAThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have Ilearned from my entertainment. What I am, and what Iwould, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,divinity, to any other's, profanation.OLIVIAGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.Exeunt MARIA and AttendantsNow, sir, what is your text?VIOLAMost sweet lady,--OLIVIAA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.Where lies your text?VIOLAIn Orsino's bosom.OLIVIAIn his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?VIOLATo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.OLIVIAO, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?VIOLAGood madam, let me see your face.OLIVIAHave you any commission from your lord to negotiatewith my face? You are now out of your text: butwe will draw the curtain and show you the picture.Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is'tnot well done?UnveilingVIOLAExcellently done, if God did all.OLIVIA'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.VIOLA'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and whiteNature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,If you will lead these graces to the graveAnd leave the world no copy.OLIVIAO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will giveout divers schedules of my beauty: it shall beinventoried, and every particle and utensillabelled to my will: as, item, two lips,indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids tothem; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Wereyou sent hither to praise me?VIOLAI see you what you are, you are too proud;But, if you were the devil, you are fair.My lord and master loves you: O, such loveCould be but recompensed, though you were crown'dThe nonpareil of beauty!OLIVIAHow does he love me?VIOLAWith adorations, fertile tears,With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.OLIVIAYour lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;And in dimension and the shape of natureA gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;He might have took his answer long ago.VIOLAIf I did love you in my master's flame,With such a suffering, such a deadly life,In your denial I would find no sense;I would not understand it.OLIVIAWhy, what would you?VIOLAMake me a willow cabin at your gate,And call upon my soul within the house;Write loyal cantons of contemned loveAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;Halloo your name to the reverberate hillsAnd make the babbling gossip of the airCry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not restBetween the elements of air and earth,But you should pity me!OLIVIAYou might do much.What is your parentage?VIOLAAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.OLIVIAGet you to your lord;I cannot love him: let him send no more;Unless, perchance, you come to me again,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.VIOLAI am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:My master, not myself, lacks recompense.Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;And let your fervor, like my master's, bePlaced in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.ExitOLIVIA'What is your parentage?''Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:soft, soft!Unless the master were the man. How now!Even so quickly may one catch the plague?Methinks I feel this youth's perfectionsWith an invisible and subtle stealthTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.What ho, Malvolio!Re-enter MALVOLIOMALVOLIOHere, madam, at your service.OLIVIARun after that same peevish messenger,The county's man: he left this ring behind him,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.Desire him not to flatter with his lord,Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.MALVOLIOMadam, I will.ExitOLIVIAI do I know not what, and fear to findMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;What is decreed must be, and be this so.ExitACT IISCENE I. The sea-coast.Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIANANTONIOWill you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?SEBASTIANBy your patience, no. My stars shine darkly overme: the malignancy of my fate might perhapsdistemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you yourleave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a badrecompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.SEBASTIANNo, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mereextravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent atouch of modesty, that you will not extort from mewhat I am willing to keep in; therefore it chargesme in manners the rather to express myself. Youmust know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,which I called Roderigo. My father was thatSebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heardof. He left behind him myself and a sister, bothborn in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;for some hour before you took me from the breach ofthe sea was my sister drowned.ANTONIOAlas the day!SEBASTIANA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembledme, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,though I could not with such estimable wonderoverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldlypublish her; she bore a mind that envy could not butcall fair. She is drowned already, sir, with saltwater, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.ANTONIOPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.SEBASTIANO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.ANTONIOIf you will not murder me for my love, let me beyour servant.SEBASTIANIf you will not undo what you have done, that is,kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, thatupon the least occasion more mine eyes will telltales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.ExitANTONIOThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!I have many enemies in Orsino's court,Else would I very shortly see thee there.But, come what may, I do adore thee so,That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.ExitSCENE II.

Receive it so.VIOLAShe took the ring of me: I'll none of it.MALVOLIOCome, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and herwill is, it should be so returned: if it be worthstooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, beit his that finds it.ExitVIOLAI left no ring with her: what means this lady?Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!She made good view of me; indeed, so much,That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,For she did speak in starts distractedly.She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passionInvites me in this churlish messenger.None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,Poor lady, she were better love a dream.Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.How easy is it for the proper-falseIn women's waxen hearts to set their forms!Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!For such as we are made of, such we be.How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.What will become of this? As I am man,My state is desperate for my master's love;As I am woman,--now alas the day!--What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!O time! thou must untangle this, not I;It is too hard a knot for me to untie!ExitSCENE III.

Does not our life consist of thefour elements?SIR ANDREWFaith, so they say; but I think it rather consistsof eating and drinking.SIR TOBY BELCHThou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!Enter ClownSIR ANDREWHere comes the fool, i' faith.ClownHow now, my hearts! did you never see the pictureof 'we three'?SIR TOBY BELCHWelcome, ass.

Now, good morrow, friends.Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,That old and antique song we heard last night:Methought it did relieve my passion much,More than light airs and recollected termsOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times:Come, but one verse.CURIOHe is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.DUKE ORSINOWho was it?CURIOFeste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the ladyOlivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.DUKE ORSINOSeek him out, and play the tune the while.Exit CURIO. Music playsCome hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,In the sweet pangs of it remember me;For such as I am all true lovers are,Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,Save in the constant image of the creatureThat is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?VIOLAIt gives a very echo to the seatWhere Love is throned.DUKE ORSINOThou dost speak masterly:My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eyeHath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:Hath it not, boy?VIOLAA little, by your favour.DUKE ORSINOWhat kind of woman is't?VIOLAOf your complexion.DUKE ORSINOShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?VIOLAAbout your years, my lord.DUKE ORSINOToo old by heaven: let still the woman takeAn elder than herself: so wears she to him,So sways she level in her husband's heart:For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,Than women's are.VIOLAI think it well, my lord.DUKE ORSINOThen let thy love be younger than thyself,Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;For women are as roses, whose fair flowerBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.VIOLAAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;To die, even when they to perfection grow!Re-enter CURIO and ClownDUKE ORSINOO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;The spinsters and the knitters in the sunAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bonesDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,And dallies with the innocence of love,Like the old age.ClownAre you ready, sir?DUKE ORSINOAy; prithee, sing.MusicSONG.ClownCome away, come away, death,And in sad cypress let me be laid;Fly away, fly away breath;I am slain by a fair cruel maid.My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,O, prepare it!My part of death, no one so trueDid share it.Not a flower, not a flower sweetOn my black coffin let there be strown;Not a friend, not a friend greetMy poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:A thousand thousand sighs to save,Lay me, O, whereSad true lover never find my grave,To weep there!DUKE ORSINOThere's for thy pains.ClownNo pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.DUKE ORSINOI'll pay thy pleasure then.ClownTruly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.DUKE ORSINOGive me now leave to leave thee.ClownNow, the melancholy god protect thee; and thetailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, forthy mind is a very opal. I would have men of suchconstancy put to sea, that their business might beevery thing and their intent every where; for that'sit that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.ExitDUKE ORSINOLet all the rest give place.CURIO and Attendants retireOnce more, Cesario,Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;But 'tis that miracle and queen of gemsThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.VIOLABut if she cannot love you, sir?DUKE ORSINOI cannot be so answer'd.VIOLASooth, but you must.Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,Hath for your love a great a pang of heartAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?DUKE ORSINOThere is no woman's sidesCan bide the beating of so strong a passionAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heartSo big, to hold so much; they lack retentionAlas, their love may be call'd appetite,No motion of the liver, but the palate,That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;But mine is all as hungry as the sea,And can digest as much: make no compareBetween that love a woman can bear meAnd that I owe Olivia.VIOLAAy, but I know--DUKE ORSINOWhat dost thou know?VIOLAToo well what love women to men may owe:In faith, they are as true of heart as we.My father had a daughter loved a man,As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,I should your lordship.DUKE ORSINOAnd what's her history?VIOLAA blank, my lord. She never told her love,But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,And with a green and yellow melancholyShe sat like patience on a monument,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?We men may say more, swear more: but indeedOur shows are more than will; for still we proveMuch in our vows, but little in our love.DUKE ORSINOBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?VIOLAI am all the daughters of my father's house,And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.Sir, shall I to this lady?DUKE ORSINOAy, that's the theme.To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,My love can give no place, bide no denay.ExeuntSCENE V.

Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,Throws down a letterfor here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.ExitEnter MALVOLIOMALVOLIO'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once toldme she did affect me: and I have heard herself comethus near, that, should she fancy, it should be oneof my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a moreexalted respect than any one else that follows her.What should I think on't?SIR TOBY BELCHHere's an overweening rogue!FABIANO, peace!

'No man must know:' if this should bethee, Malvolio?SIR TOBY BELCHMarry, hang thee, brock!MALVOLIO[Reads]I may command where I adore;But silence, like a Lucrece knife,With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.FABIANA fustian riddle!SIR TOBY BELCHExcellent wench, say I.MALVOLIO'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, letme see, let me see, let me see.FABIANWhat dish o' poison has she dressed him!SIR TOBY BELCHAnd with what wing the staniel cheques at it!MALVOLIO'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may commandme: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this isevident to any formal capacity; there is noobstruction in this: and the end,--what shouldthat alphabetical position portend? If I could makethat resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,I,--SIR TOBY BELCHO, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.FABIANSowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be asrank as a fox.MALVOLIOM,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.FABIANDid not I say he would work it out? the cur isexcellent at faults.MALVOLIOM,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.FABIANAnd O shall end, I hope.SIR TOBY BELCHAy, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!MALVOLIOAnd then I comes behind.FABIANAy, an you had any eye behind you, you might seemore detraction at your heels than fortunes beforeyou.MALVOLIOM, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: andyet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, forevery one of these letters are in my name. Soft!here follows prose.Reads'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars Iam above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: someare born great, some achieve greatness, and somehave greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates opentheir hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Beopposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; letthy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself intothe trick of singularity: she thus advises theethat sighs for thee. Remember who commended thyyellow stockings, and wished to see thee evercross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou artmade, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me seethee a steward still, the fellow of servants, andnot worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.She that would alter services with thee,THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this isopen. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off grossacquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jademe; for every reason excites to this, that my ladyloves me. She did commend my yellow stockings oflate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;and in this she manifests herself to my love, andwith a kind of injunction drives me to these habitsof her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I willbe strange, stout, in yellow stockings, andcross-gartered, even with the swiftness of puttingon. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet apostscript.Reads'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thouentertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;thy smiles become thee well; therefore in mypresence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will doeverything that thou wilt have me.ExitFABIANI will not give my part of this sport for a pensionof thousands to be paid from the Sophy.SIR TOBY BELCHI could marry this wench for this device.SIR ANDREWSo could I too.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.SIR ANDREWNor I neither.FABIANHere comes my noble gull-catcher.Re-enter MARIASIR TOBY BELCHWilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?SIR ANDREWOr o' mine either?SIR TOBY BELCHShall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thybond-slave?SIR ANDREWI' faith, or I either?SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, thou hast put him in such a dream, that whenthe image of it leaves him he must run mad.MARIANay, but say true; does it work upon him?SIR TOBY BELCHLike aqua-vitae with a midwife.MARIAIf you will then see the fruits of the sport, markhis first approach before my lady: he will come toher in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour sheabhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;and he will smile upon her, which will now be sounsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to amelancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn himinto a notable contempt. If you will see it, followme.SIR TOBY BELCHTo the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!SIR ANDREWI'll make one too.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabourVIOLASave thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live bythy tabour?ClownNo, sir, I live by the church.VIOLAArt thou a churchman?ClownNo such matter, sir: I do live by the church; forI do live at my house, and my house doth stand bythe church.VIOLASo thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if abeggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thytabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.ClownYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence isbut a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly thewrong side may be turned outward!VIOLANay, that's certain; they that dally nicely withwords may quickly make them wanton.ClownI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.VIOLAWhy, man?ClownWhy, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with thatword might make my sister wanton. But indeed wordsare very rascals since bonds disgraced them.VIOLAThy reason, man?ClownTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words; andwords are grown so false, I am loath to provereason with them.VIOLAI warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.ClownNot so, sir, I do care for something; but in myconscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that beto care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.VIOLAArt not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?ClownNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: shewill keep no fool, sir, till she be married; andfools are as like husbands as pilchards are toherrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed nother fool, but her corrupter of words.VIOLAI saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.ClownFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, butthe fool should be as oft with your master as withmy mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.VIOLANay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.Hold, there's expenses for thee.ClownNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!VIOLABy my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick forone;Asidethough I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thylady within?ClownWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?VIOLAYes, being kept together and put to use.ClownI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bringa Cressida to this Troilus.VIOLAI understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.ClownThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging buta beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady iswithin, sir. I will construe to them whence youcome; who you are and what you would are out of mywelkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.ExitVIOLAThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool;And to do that well craves a kind of wit:He must observe their mood on whom he jests,The quality of persons, and the time,And, like the haggard, cheque at every featherThat comes before his eye. This is a practiseAs full of labour as a wise man's artFor folly that he wisely shows is fit;But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREWSIR TOBY BELCHSave you, gentleman.VIOLAAnd you, sir.SIR ANDREWDieu vous garde, monsieur.VIOLAEt vous aussi; votre serviteur.SIR ANDREWI hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.SIR TOBY BELCHWill you encounter the house? my niece is desirousyou should enter, if your trade be to her.VIOLAI am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is thelist of my voyage.SIR TOBY BELCHTaste your legs, sir; put them to motion.VIOLAMy legs do better understand me, sir, than Iunderstand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.SIR TOBY BELCHI mean, to go, sir, to enter.VIOLAI will answer you with gait and entrance. But weare prevented.Enter OLIVIA and MARIAMost excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rainodours on you!SIR ANDREWThat youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.VIOLAMy matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnantand vouchsafed ear.SIR ANDREW'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'emall three all ready.OLIVIALet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIAGive me your hand, sir.VIOLAMy duty, madam, and most humble service.OLIVIAWhat is your name?VIOLACesario is your servant's name, fair princess.OLIVIAMy servant, sir! 'Twas never merry worldSince lowly feigning was call'd compliment:You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.VIOLAAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours:Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.OLIVIAFor him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!VIOLAMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughtsOn his behalf.OLIVIAO, by your leave, I pray you,I bade you never speak again of him:But, would you undertake another suit,I had rather hear you to solicit thatThan music from the spheres.VIOLADear lady,--OLIVIAGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,After the last enchantment you did here,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuseMyself, my servant and, I fear me, you:Under your hard construction must I sit,To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?Have you not set mine honour at the stakeAnd baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughtsThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receivingEnough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.VIOLAI pity you.OLIVIAThat's a degree to love.VIOLANo, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,That very oft we pity enemies.OLIVIAWhy, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!If one should be a prey, how much the betterTo fall before the lion than the wolf!Clock strikesThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:There lies your way, due west.VIOLAThen westward-ho! Grace and good dispositionAttend your ladyship!You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?OLIVIAStay:I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.VIOLAThat you do think you are not what you are.OLIVIAIf I think so, I think the same of you.VIOLAThen think you right: I am not what I am.OLIVIAI would you were as I would have you be!VIOLAWould it be better, madam, than I am?I wish it might, for now I am your fool.OLIVIAO, what a deal of scorn looks beautifulIn the contempt and anger of his lip!A murderous guilt shows not itself more soonThan love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.Cesario, by the roses of the spring,By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,But rather reason thus with reason fetter,Love sought is good, but given unsought better.VIOLABy innocence I swear, and by my youthI have one heart, one bosom and one truth,And that no woman has; nor never noneShall mistress be of it, save I alone.And so adieu, good madam: never moreWill I my master's tears to you deplore.OLIVIAYet come again; for thou perhaps mayst moveThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.ExeuntSCENE II. OLIVIA's house.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIANSIR ANDREWNo, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.SIR TOBY BELCHThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.FABIANYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.SIR ANDREWMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to thecount's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;I saw't i' the orchard.SIR TOBY BELCHDid she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.SIR ANDREWAs plain as I see you now.FABIANThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.SIR ANDREW'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?FABIANI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths ofjudgment and reason.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd they have been grand-jury-men since before Noahwas a sailor.FABIANShe did show favour to the youth in your sight onlyto exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, toput fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.You should then have accosted her; and with someexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you shouldhave banged the youth into dumbness. This waslooked for at your hand, and this was balked: thedouble gilt of this opportunity you let time washoff, and you are now sailed into the north of mylady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicleon a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it bysome laudable attempt either of valour or policy.SIR ANDREWAn't be any way, it must be with valour; for policyI hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as apolitician.SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis ofvalour. Challenge me the count's youth to fightwith him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shalltake note of it; and assure thyself, there is nolove-broker in the world can more prevail in man'scommendation with woman than report of valour.FABIANThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.SIR ANDREWWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?SIR TOBY BELCHGo, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and funof invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not beamiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet ofpaper, although the sheet were big enough for thebed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thouwrite with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.SIR ANDREWWhere shall I find you?SIR TOBY BELCHWe'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.Exit SIR ANDREWFABIANThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.SIR TOBY BELCHI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousandstrong, or so.FABIANWe shall have a rare letter from him: but you'llnot deliver't?SIR TOBY BELCHNever trust me, then; and by all means stir on theyouth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropescannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he wereopened, and you find so much blood in his liver aswill clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest ofthe anatomy.FABIANAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage nogreat presage of cruelty.Enter MARIASIR TOBY BELCHLook, where the youngest wren of nine comes.MARIAIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselfinto stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio isturned heathen, a very renegado; for there is noChristian, that means to be saved by believingrightly, can ever believe such impossible passagesof grossness. He's in yellow stockings.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd cross-gartered?MARIAMost villanously; like a pedant that keeps a schooli' the church. I have dogged him, like hismurderer. He does obey every point of the letterthat I dropped to betray him: he does smile hisface into more lines than is in the new map with theaugmentation of the Indies: you have not seen sucha thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling thingsat him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,he'll smile and take't for a great favour.SIR TOBY BELCHCome, bring us, bring us where he is.ExeuntSCENE III. A street.Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIOSEBASTIANI would not by my will have troubled you;But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.ANTONIOI could not stay behind you: my desire,More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;And not all love to see you, though so muchAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,But jealousy what might befall your travel,Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,Unguided and unfriended, often proveRough and unhospitable: my willing love,The rather by these arguments of fear,Set forth in your pursuit.SEBASTIANMy kind Antonio,I can no other answer make but thanks,And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turnsAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,You should find better dealing. What's to do?Shall we go see the reliques of this town?ANTONIOTo-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.SEBASTIANI am not weary, and 'tis long to night:I pray you, let us satisfy our eyesWith the memorials and the things of fameThat do renown this city.ANTONIOWould you'ld pardon me;I do not without danger walk these streets:Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleysI did some service; of such note indeed,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.SEBASTIANBelike you slew great number of his people.ANTONIOThe offence is not of such a bloody nature;Albeit the quality of the time and quarrelMight well have given us bloody argument.It might have since been answer'd in repayingWhat we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,Most of our city did: only myself stood out;For which, if I be lapsed in this place,I shall pay dear.SEBASTIANDo not then walk too open.ANTONIOIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledgeWith viewing of the town: there shall you have me.SEBASTIANWhy I your purse?ANTONIOHaply your eye shall light upon some toyYou have desire to purchase; and your store,I think, is not for idle markets, sir.SEBASTIANI'll be your purse-bearer and leave youFor an hour.ANTONIOTo the Elephant.SEBASTIANI do remember.ExeuntSCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.Enter OLIVIA and MARIAOLIVIAI have sent after him: he says he'll come;How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.I speak too loud.Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:Where is Malvolio?MARIAHe's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. Heis, sure, possessed, madam.OLIVIAWhy, what's the matter? does he rave?MARIANo. madam, he does nothing but smile: yourladyship were best to have some guard about you, ifhe come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.OLIVIAGo call him hither.Exit MARIAI am as mad as he,If sad and merry madness equal be.Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIOHow now, Malvolio!MALVOLIOSweet lady, ho, ho.OLIVIASmilest thou?I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.MALVOLIOSad, lady! I could be sad: this does make someobstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; butwhat of that? if it please the eye of one, it iswith me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, andplease all.'OLIVIAWhy, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?MALVOLIONot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. Itdid come to his hands, and commands shall beexecuted: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.OLIVIAWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?MALVOLIOTo bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.OLIVIAGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kissthy hand so oft?MARIAHow do you, Malvolio?MALVOLIOAt your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.MARIAWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?MALVOLIO'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.OLIVIAWhat meanest thou by that, Malvolio?MALVOLIO'Some are born great,'--OLIVIAHa!MALVOLIO'Some achieve greatness,'--OLIVIAWhat sayest thou?MALVOLIO'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'OLIVIAHeaven restore thee!MALVOLIO'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--OLIVIAThy yellow stockings!MALVOLIO'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'OLIVIACross-gartered!MALVOLIO'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--OLIVIAAm I made?MALVOLIO'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'OLIVIAWhy, this is very midsummer madness.Enter ServantServantMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's isreturned: I could hardly entreat him back: heattends your ladyship's pleasure.OLIVIAI'll come to him.Exit ServantGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where'smy cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a specialcare of him: I would not have him miscarry for thehalf of my dowry.Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIAMALVOLIOO, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man thanSir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly withthe letter: she sends him on purpose, that I mayappear stubborn to him; for she incites me to thatin the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; putthyself into the trick of singularity;' andconsequently sets down the manner how; as, a sadface, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in thehabit of some sir of note, and so forth. I havelimed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make methankful! And when she went away now, 'Let thisfellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, norafter my degree, but fellow. Why, every thingadheres together, that no dram of a scruple, noscruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulousor unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothingthat can be can come between me and the fullprospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is thedoer of this, and he is to be thanked.Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIANSIR TOBY BELCHWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If allthe devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legionhimself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.FABIANHere he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?how is't with you, man?MALVOLIOGo off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: gooff.MARIALo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did notI tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have acare of him.MALVOLIOAh, ha! does she so?SIR TOBY BELCHGo to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gentlywith him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? howis't with you? What, man! defy the devil:consider, he's an enemy to mankind.MALVOLIODo you know what you say?MARIALa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takesit at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!FABIANCarry his water to the wise woman.MARIAMarry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if Ilive. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.MALVOLIOHow now, mistress!MARIAO Lord!SIR TOBY BELCHPrithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: doyou not see you move him? let me alone with him.FABIANNo way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend isrough, and will not be roughly used.SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?MALVOLIOSir!SIR TOBY BELCHAy, Biddy, come with me.

Myniece is already in the belief that he's mad: wemay carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,till our very pastime, tired out of breath, promptus to have mercy on him: at which time we willbring the device to the bar and crown thee for afinder of madmen. But see, but see.Enter SIR ANDREWFABIANMore matter for a May morning.SIR ANDREWHere's the challenge, read it: warrant there'svinegar and pepper in't.FABIANIs't so saucy?SIR ANDREWAy, is't, I warrant him: do but read.SIR TOBY BELCHGive me.Reads'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'FABIANGood, and valiant.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'FABIANA good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in mysight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thythroat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'FABIANVery brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if itbe thy chance to kill me,'--FABIANGood.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'FABIANStill you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy uponone of our souls!

Away!SIR ANDREWNay, let me alone for swearing.ExitSIR TOBY BELCHNow will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviorof the young gentleman gives him out to be of goodcapacity and breeding; his employment between hislord and my niece confirms no less: therefore thisletter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed noterror in the youth: he will find it comes from aclodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge byword of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable reportof valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know hisyouth will aptly receive it, into a most hideousopinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.This will so fright them both that they will killone another by the look, like cockatrices.Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLAFABIANHere he comes with your niece: give them way tillhe take leave, and presently after him.SIR TOBY BELCHI will meditate the while upon some horrid messagefor a challenge.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIAOLIVIAI have said too much unto a heart of stoneAnd laid mine honour too unchary out:There's something in me that reproves my fault;But such a headstrong potent fault it is,That it but mocks reproof.VIOLAWith the same 'havior that your passion bearsGoes on my master's grief.OLIVIAHere, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;And I beseech you come again to-morrow.What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,That honour saved may upon asking give?VIOLANothing but this; your true love for my master.OLIVIAHow with mine honour may I give him thatWhich I have given to you?VIOLAI will acquit you.OLIVIAWell, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.ExitRe-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIANSIR TOBY BELCHGentleman, God save thee.VIOLAAnd you, sir.SIR TOBY BELCHThat defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of whatnature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knownot; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody asthe hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, forthy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.VIOLAYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrelto me: my remembrance is very free and clear fromany image of offence done to any man.SIR TOBY BELCHYou'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,if you hold your life at any price, betake you toyour guard; for your opposite hath in him whatyouth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.VIOLAI pray you, sir, what is he?SIR TOBY BELCHHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and oncarpet consideration; but he is a devil in privatebrawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; andhis incensement at this moment is so implacable,that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of deathand sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.VIOLAI will return again into the house and desire someconduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heardof some kind of men that put quarrels purposely onothers, to taste their valour: belike this is a manof that quirk.SIR TOBY BELCHSir, no; his indignation derives itself out of avery competent injury: therefore, get you on andgive him his desire. Back you shall not to thehouse, unless you undertake that with me which withas much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle youmust, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.VIOLAThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do methis courteous office, as to know of the knight whatmy offence to him is: it is something of mynegligence, nothing of my purpose.SIR TOBY BELCHI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by thisgentleman till my return.ExitVIOLAPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?FABIANI know the knight is incensed against you, even to amortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.VIOLAI beseech you, what manner of man is he?FABIANNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him byhis form, as you are like to find him in the proofof his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possiblyhave found in any part of Illyria. Will you walktowards him? I will make your peace with him if Ican.VIOLAI shall be much bound to you for't: I am one thathad rather go with sir priest than sir knight: Icare not who knows so much of my mettle.ExeuntRe-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREWSIR TOBY BELCHWhy, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such afirago.

Antioch. A room in the palace.Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followersANTIOCHUSYoung prince of Tyre, you have at large receivedThe danger of the task you undertake.PERICLESI have, Antiochus, and, with a soulEmbolden'd with the glory of her praise,Think death no hazard in this enterprise.ANTIOCHUSBring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,For the embracements even of Jove himself;At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,The senate-house of planets all did sit,To knit in her their best perfections.Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUSPERICLESSee where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the kingOf every virtue gives renown to men!Her face the book of praises, where is readNothing but curious pleasures, as from thenceSorrow were ever razed and testy wrathCould never be her mild companion.You gods that made me man, and sway in love,That have inflamed desire in my breastTo taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,Or die in the adventure, be my helps,As I am son and servant to your will,To compass such a boundless happiness!ANTIOCHUSPrince Pericles,--PERICLESThat would be son to great Antiochus.ANTIOCHUSBefore thee stands this fair Hesperides,With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to viewHer countless glory, which desert must gain;And which, without desert, because thine eyePresumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,That without covering, save yon field of stars,Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;And with dead cheeks advise thee to desistFor going on death's net, whom none resist.PERICLESAntiochus, I thank thee, who hath taughtMy frail mortality to know itself,And by those fearful objects to prepareThis body, like to them, to what I must;For death remember'd should be like a mirror,Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.I'll make my will then, and, as sick men doWho know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;So I bequeath a happy peace to youAnd all good men, as every prince should do;My riches to the earth from whence they came;But my unspotted fire of love to you.To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUSThus ready for the way of life or death,I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.ANTIOCHUSScorning advice, read the conclusion then:Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.DaughterOf all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!PERICLESLike a bold champion, I assume the lists,Nor ask advice of any other thoughtBut faithfulness and courage.He reads the riddleI am no viper, yet I feedOn mother's flesh which did me breed.I sought a husband, in which labourI found that kindness in a father:He's father, son, and husband mild;I mother, wife, and yet his child.How they may be, and yet in two,As you will live, resolve it you.Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powersThat give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUSWere not this glorious casket stored with ill:But I must tell you, now my thoughts revoltFor he's no man on whom perfections waitThat, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:But being play'd upon before your time,Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.Good sooth, I care not for you.ANTIOCHUSPrince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.For that's an article within our law,As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:Either expound now, or receive your sentence.PERICLESGreat king,Few love to hear the sins they love to act;'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.Who has a book of all that monarchs do,He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole castsCopp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'dBy man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law'stheir will;And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?It is enough you know; and it is fit,What being more known grows worse, to smother it.All love the womb that their first being bred,Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.ANTIOCHUS[Aside] Heaven, that I had thy head! he has foundthe meaning:But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,Though by the tenor of our strict edict,Your exposition misinterpreting,We might proceed to cancel of your days;Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a treeAs your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:Forty days longer we do respite you;If by which time our secret be undone,This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:And until then your entertain shall beAs doth befit our honour and your worth.Exeunt all but PERICLESPERICLESHow courtesy would seem to cover sin,When what is done is like an hypocrite,The which is good in nothing but in sight!If it be true that I interpret false,Then were it certain you were not so badAs with foul incest to abuse your soul;Where now you're both a father and a son,By your untimely claspings with your child,Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;And she an eater of her mother's flesh,By the defiling of her parent's bed;And both like serpents are, who though they feedOn sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those menBlush not in actions blacker than the night,Will shun no course to keep them from the light.One sin, I know, another doth provoke;Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:Poison and treason are the hands of sin,Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.ExitRe-enter ANTIOCHUSANTIOCHUSHe hath found the meaning, for which we meanTo have his head.He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sinIn such a loathed manner;And therefore instantly this prince must die:For by his fall my honour must keep high.Who attends us there?Enter THALIARDTHALIARDDoth your highness call?ANTIOCHUSThaliard,You are of our chamber, and our mind partakesHer private actions to your secrecy;And for your faithfulness we will advance you.Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:It fits thee not to ask the reason why,Because we bid it. Say, is it done?THALIARDMy lord,'Tis done.ANTIOCHUSEnough.Enter a MessengerLet your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.MessengerMy lord, prince Pericles is fled.ExitANTIOCHUSAs thouWilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shotFrom a well-experienced archer hits the markHis eye doth level at, so thou ne'er returnUnless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'THALIARDMy lord,If I can get him within my pistol's length,I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.ANTIOCHUSThaliard, adieu!Exit THALIARDTill Pericles be dead,My heart can lend no succor to my head.ExitSCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.Enter PERICLESPERICLES[To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why shouldthis change of thoughts,The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,Be my so used a guest as not an hour,In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,That have their first conception by mis-dread,Have after-nourishment and life by care;And what was first but fear what might be done,Grows elder now and cares it be not done.And so with me: the great Antiochus,'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,Since he's so great can make his will his act,Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;Nor boots it me to say I honour him.If he suspect I may dishonour him:And what may make him blush in being known,He'll stop the course by which it might be known;With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,And with the ostent of war will look so huge,Amazement shall drive courage from the state;Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:Which care of them, not pity of myself,Who am no more but as the tops of trees,Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,And punish that before that he would punish.Enter HELICANUS, with other LordsFirst LordJoy and all comfort in your sacred breast!Second LordAnd keep your mind, till you return to us,Peaceful and comfortable!HELICANUSPeace, peace, and give experience tongue.They do abuse the king that flatter him:For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,He flatters you, makes war upon your life.Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;I cannot be much lower than my knees.PERICLESAll leave us else; but let your cares o'erlookWhat shipping and what lading's in our haven,And then return to us.Exeunt LordsHelicanus, thouHast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?HELICANUSAn angry brow, dread lord.PERICLESIf there be such a dart in princes' frowns,How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?HELICANUSHow dare the plants look up to heaven, from whenceThey have their nourishment?PERICLESThou know'st I have powerTo take thy life from thee.HELICANUS[Kneeling]I have ground the axe myself;Do you but strike the blow.PERICLESRise, prithee, rise.Sit down: thou art no flatterer:I thank thee for it; and heaven forbidThat kings should let their ears hear theirfaults hid!Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,What wouldst thou have me do?HELICANUSTo bear with patienceSuch griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.PERICLESThou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,That minister'st a potion unto meThat thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.From whence an issue I might propagate,Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:Which by my knowledge found, the sinful fatherSeem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thouknow'st this,'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,Under the covering of a careful night,Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fearsDecrease not, but grow faster than the years:And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,That I should open to the listening airHow many worthy princes' bloods were shed,To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:When all, for mine, if I may call offence,Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:Which love to all, of which thyself art one,Who now reprovest me for it,--HELICANUSAlas, sir!PERICLESDrew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,Musings into my mind, with thousand doubtsHow I might stop this tempest ere it came;And finding little comfort to relieve them,I thought it princely charity to grieve them.HELICANUSWell, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,Who either by public war or private treasonWill take away your life.Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,Till that his rage and anger be forgot,Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.Your rule direct to any; if to me.Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.PERICLESI do not doubt thy faith;But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?HELICANUSWe'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,From whence we had our being and our birth.PERICLESTyre, I now look from thee then, and to TarsusIntend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.The care I had and have of subjects' goodOn thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.ExeuntSCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.Enter THALIARDTHALIARDSo, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must Ikill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure tobe hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceivehe was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,being bid to ask what he would of the king, desiredhe might know none of his secrets: now do I see hehad some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be avillain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath tobe one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of TyreHELICANUSYou shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,Further to question me of your king's departure:His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.THALIARD[Aside] How! the king gone!HELICANUSIf further yet you will be satisfied,Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.Being at Antioch--THALIARD[Aside] What from Antioch?HELICANUSRoyal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,With whom each minute threatens life or death.THALIARD[Aside] Well, I perceiveI shall not be hang'd now, although I would;But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!HELICANUSLord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.THALIARDFrom him I comeWith message unto princely Pericles;But since my landing I have understoodYour lord has betook himself to unknown travels,My message must return from whence it came.HELICANUSWe have no reason to desire it,Commended to our master, not to us:Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.ExeuntSCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and othersCLEONMy Dionyza, shall we rest us here,And by relating tales of others' griefs,See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?DIONYZAThat were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;For who digs hills because they do aspireThrows down one mountain to cast up a higher.O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.CLEONO Dionyza,Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?Our tongues and sorrows do sound deepOur woes into the air; our eyes do weep,Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,They may awake their helps to comfort them.I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.DIONYZAI'll do my best, sir.CLEONThis Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,A city on whom plenty held full hand,For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,Like one another's glass to trim them by:Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,And not so much to feed on as delight;All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,The name of help grew odious to repeat.DIONYZAO, 'tis too true.CLEONBut see what heaven can do! By this our change,These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,Were all too little to content and please,Although they gave their creatures in abundance,As houses are defiled for want of use,They are now starved for want of exercise:Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,Must have inventions to delight the taste,Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,Thought nought too curious, are ready nowTo eat those little darlings whom they loved.So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wifeDraw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;Here many sink, yet those which see them fallHave scarce strength left to give them burial.Is not this true?DIONYZAOur cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.CLEONO, let those cities that of plenty's cupAnd her prosperities so largely taste,With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.Enter a LordLordWhere's the lord governor?CLEONHere.Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,For comfort is too far for us to expect.LordWe have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,A portly sail of ships make hitherward.CLEONI thought as much.One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,That may succeed as his inheritor;And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,Taking advantage of our misery,Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,To beat us down, the which are down already;And make a conquest of unhappy me,Whereas no glory's got to overcome.LordThat's the least fear; for, by the semblanceOf their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,And come to us as favourers, not as foes.CLEONThou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.But bring they what they will and what they can,What need we fear?The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.Go tell their general we attend him here,To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,And what he craves.LordI go, my lord.ExitCLEONWelcome is peace, if he on peace consist;If wars, we are unable to resist.Enter PERICLES with AttendantsPERICLESLord governor, for so we hear you are,Let not our ships and number of our menBe like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,And seen the desolation of your streets:Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,But to relieve them of their heavy load;And these our ships, you happily may thinkAre like the Trojan horse was stuff'd withinWith bloody veins, expecting overthrow,Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.AllThe gods of Greece protect you!And we'll pray for you.PERICLESArise, I pray you, rise:We do not look for reverence, but to love,And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.CLEONThe which when any shall not gratify,Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--Your grace is welcome to our town and us.PERICLESWhich welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.ExeuntACT IIEnter GOWERGOWERHere have you seen a mighty kingHis child, I wis, to incest bring;A better prince and benign lord,That will prove awful both in deed and word.Be quiet then as men should be,Till he hath pass'd necessity.I'll show you those in troubles reign,Losing a mite, a mountain gain.The good in conversation,To whom I give my benison,Is still at Tarsus, where each manThinks all is writ he speken can;And, to remember what he does,Build his statue to make him glorious:But tidings to the contraryAre brought your eyes; what need speak I?DUMB SHOW.Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all the train with them. Enter at another door a Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at anotherGood Helicane, that stay'd at home,Not to eat honey like a droneFrom others' labours; for though he striveTo killen bad, keep good alive;And to fulfil his prince' desire,Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:How Thaliard came full bent with sinAnd had intent to murder him;And that in Tarsus was not bestLonger for him to make his rest.He, doing so, put forth to seas,Where when men been, there's seldom ease;For now the wind begins to blow;Thunder above and deeps belowMake such unquiet, that the shipShould house him safe is wreck'd and split;And he, good prince, having all lost,By waves from coast to coast is tost:All perishen of man, of pelf,Ne aught escapen but himself;Till fortune, tired with doing bad,Threw him ashore, to give him glad:And here he comes. What shall be next,Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.ExitSCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.Enter PERICLES, wetPERICLESYet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly manIs but a substance that must yield to you;And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breathNothing to think on but ensuing death:Let it suffice the greatness of your powersTo have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;And having thrown him from your watery grave,Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.Enter three FISHERMENFirst FishermanWhat, ho, Pilch!Second FishermanHa, come and bring away the nets!First FishermanWhat, Patch-breech, I say!Third FishermanWhat say you, master?First FishermanLook how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'llfetch thee with a wanion.Third FishermanFaith, master, I am thinking of the poor men thatwere cast away before us even now.First FishermanAlas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear whatpitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.Third FishermanNay, master, said not I as much when I saw theporpus how he bounced and tumbled? they saythey're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, Imarvel how the fishes live in the sea.First FishermanWhy, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up thelittle ones: I can compare our rich misers tonothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays andtumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and atlast devours them all at a mouthful: such whaleshave I heard on o' the land, who never leave gapingtill they've swallowed the whole parish, church,steeple, bells, and all.PERICLES[Aside] A pretty moral.Third FishermanBut, master, if I had been the sexton, I would havebeen that day in the belfry.Second FishermanWhy, man?Third FishermanBecause he should have swallowed me too: and when Ihad been in his belly, I would have kept such ajangling of the bells, that he should never haveleft, till he cast bells, steeple, church, andparish up again. But if the good King Simonideswere of my mind,--PERICLES[Aside] Simonides!Third FishermanWe would purge the land of these drones, that robthe bee of her honey.PERICLES[Aside] How from the finny subject of the seaThese fishers tell the infirmities of men;And from their watery empire recollectAll that may men approve or men detect!Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.Second FishermanHonest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a dayfits you, search out of the calendar, and nobodylook after it.PERICLESMay see the sea hath cast upon your coast.Second FishermanWhat a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in ourway!PERICLESA man whom both the waters and the wind,In that vast tennis-court, have made the ballFor them to play upon, entreats you pity him:He asks of you, that never used to beg.First FishermanNo, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in ourcountry Greece gets more with begging than we can dowith working.Second FishermanCanst thou catch any fishes, then?PERICLESI never practised it.Second FishermanNay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothingto be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.PERICLESWhat I have been I have forgot to know;But what I am, want teaches me to think on:A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,And have no more of life than may sufficeTo give my tongue that heat to ask your help;Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,For that I am a man, pray see me buried.First FishermanDie quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, ahandsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, andwe'll have flesh for holidays, fish forfasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,and thou shalt be welcome.PERICLESI thank you, sir.Second FishermanHark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.PERICLESI did but crave.Second FishermanBut crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so Ishall 'scape whipping.PERICLESWhy, are all your beggars whipped, then?Second FishermanO, not all, my friend, not all; for if all yourbeggars were whipped, I would wish no better officethan to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up thenet.Exit with Third FishermanPERICLES[Aside] How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!First FishermanHark you, sir, do you know where ye are?PERICLESNot well.First FishermanWhy, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, andour king the good Simonides.PERICLESThe good King Simonides, do you call him.First FishermanAy, sir; and he deserves so to be called for hispeaceable reign and good government.PERICLESHe is a happy king, since he gains from his subjectsthe name of good by his government. How far is hiscourt distant from this shore?First FishermanMarry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tellyou, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is herbirth-day; and there are princes and knights comefrom all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.PERICLESWere my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wishto make one there.First FishermanO, sir, things must be as they may; and what a mancannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a netSecond FishermanHelp, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardlycome out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and'tis turned to a rusty armour.PERICLESAn armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,Which my dead father did bequeath to me.With this strict charge, even as he left his life,'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shieldTwixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--The which the gods protect thee from!--maydefend thee.'It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,Since I have here my father's gift in's will.First FishermanWhat mean you, sir?PERICLESTo beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,For it was sometime target to a king;I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,And for his sake I wish the having of it;And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,Where with it I may appear a gentleman;And if that ever my low fortune's better,I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.First FishermanWhy, wilt thou tourney for the lady?PERICLESI'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.First FishermanWhy, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!Second FishermanAy, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made upthis garment through the rough seams of the waters:there are certain condolements, certain vails. Ihope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember fromwhence you had it.PERICLESBelieve 't, I will.By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,This jewel holds his building on my arm:Unto thy value I will mount myselfUpon a courser, whose delightful stepsShall make the gazer joy to see him tread.Only, my friend, I yet am unprovidedOf a pair of bases.Second FishermanWe'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown tomake thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.PERICLESThen honour be but a goal to my will,This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.ExeuntSCENE II.

The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tiltingSIMONIDESKnights,To say you're welcome were superfluous.To place upon the volume of your deeds,As in a title-page, your worth in arms,Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,Since every worth in show commends itself.Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:You are princes and my guests.THAISABut you, my knight and guest;To whom this wreath of victory I give,And crown you king of this day's happiness.PERICLES'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.SIMONIDESCall it by what you will, the day is yours;And here, I hope, is none that envies it.In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,To make some good, but others to exceed;And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'the feast,--For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.KNIGHTSWe are honour'd much by good Simonides.SIMONIDESYour presence glads our days: honour we love;For who hates honour hates the gods above.MarshalSir, yonder is your place.PERICLESSome other is more fit.First KnightContend not, sir; for we are gentlemenThat neither in our hearts nor outward eyesEnvy the great nor do the low despise.PERICLESYou are right courteous knights.SIMONIDESSit, sir, sit.PERICLESBy Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,These cates resist me, she but thought upon.THAISABy Juno, that is queen of marriage,All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.SIMONIDESHe's but a country gentleman;Has done no more than other knights have done;Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.THAISATo me he seems like diamond to glass.PERICLESYon king's to me like to my father's picture,Which tells me in that glory once he was;Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,And he the sun, for them to reverence;None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,He's both their parent, and he is their grave,And gives them what he will, not what they crave.SIMONIDESWhat, are you merry, knights?KnightsWho can be other in this royal presence?SIMONIDESHere, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--We drink this health to you.KNIGHTSWe thank your grace.SIMONIDESYet pause awhile:Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,As if the entertainment in our courtHad not a show might countervail his worth.Note it not you, Thaisa?THAISAWhat is itTo me, my father?SIMONIDESO, attend, my daughter:Princes in this should live like gods above,Who freely give to every one that comesTo honour them:And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.THAISAAlas, my father, it befits not meUnto a stranger knight to be so bold:He may my proffer take for an offence,Since men take women's gifts for impudence.SIMONIDESHow!Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.THAISA[Aside] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.SIMONIDESAnd furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,Of whence he is, his name and parentage.THAISAThe king my father, sir, has drunk to you.PERICLESI thank him.THAISAWishing it so much blood unto your life.PERICLESI thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.THAISAAnd further he desires to know of you,Of whence you are, your name and parentage.PERICLESA gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;My education been in arts and arms;Who, looking for adventures in the world,Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.THAISAHe thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,A gentleman of Tyre,Who only by misfortune of the seasBereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.SIMONIDESNow, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,And will awake him from his melancholy.Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,And waste the time, which looks for other revels.Even in your armours, as you are address'd,Will very well become a soldier's dance.I will not have excuse, with saying thisLoud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,Since they love men in arms as well as beds.The Knights danceSo, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.Come, sir;Here is a lady that wants breathing too:And I have heard, you knights of TyreAre excellent in making ladies trip;And that their measures are as excellent.PERICLESIn those that practise them they are, my lord.SIMONIDESO, that's as much as you would be deniedOf your fair courtesy.The Knights and Ladies danceUnclasp, unclasp:Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.To PERICLESBut you the best.

I am beholding to youFor your sweet music this last night: I doProtest my ears were never better fedWith such delightful pleasing harmony.PERICLESIt is your grace's pleasure to commend;Not my desert.SIMONIDESSir, you are music's master.PERICLESThe worst of all her scholars, my good lord.SIMONIDESLet me ask you one thing:What do you think of my daughter, sir?PERICLESA most virtuous princess.SIMONIDESAnd she is fair too, is she not?PERICLESAs a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.SIMONIDESSir, my daughter thinks very well of you;Ay, so well, that you must be her master,And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.PERICLESI am unworthy for her schoolmaster.SIMONIDESShe thinks not so; peruse this writing else.PERICLES[Aside] What's here?A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,A stranger and distressed gentleman,That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,But bent all offices to honour her.SIMONIDESThou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou artA villain.PERICLESBy the gods, I have not:Never did thought of mine levy offence;Nor never did my actions yet commenceA deed might gain her love or your displeasure.SIMONIDESTraitor, thou liest.PERICLESTraitor!SIMONIDESAy, traitor.PERICLESEven in his throat--unless it be the king--That calls me traitor, I return the lie.SIMONIDES[Aside] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.PERICLESMy actions are as noble as my thoughts,That never relish'd of a base descent.I came unto your court for honour's cause,And not to be a rebel to her state;And he that otherwise accounts of me,This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.SIMONIDESNo?Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.Enter THAISAPERICLESThen, as you are as virtuous as fair,Resolve your angry father, if my tongueDid ere solicit, or my hand subscribeTo any syllable that made love to you.THAISAWhy, sir, say if you had,Who takes offence at that would make me glad?SIMONIDESYea, mistress, are you so peremptory?AsideI am glad on't with all my heart.--I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.Will you, not having my consent,Bestow your love and your affectionsUpon a stranger?Asidewho, for aught I know,May be, nor can I think the contrary,As great in blood as I myself.--Therefore hear you, mistress; either frameYour will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--Man and wife:Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--What, are you both pleased?THAISAYes, if you love me, sir.PERICLESEven as my life, or blood that fosters it.SIMONIDESWhat, are you both agreed?BOTHYes, if it please your majesty.SIMONIDESIt pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;And then with what haste you can get you to bed.ExeuntACT IIIEnter GOWERGOWERNow sleep y-slaked hath the rout;No din but snores the house about,Made louder by the o'er-fed breastOf this most pompous marriage-feast.The cat, with eyne of burning coal,Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,E'er the blither for their drouth.Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.Where, by the loss of maidenhead,A babe is moulded. Be attent,And time that is so briefly spentWith your fine fancies quaintly eche:What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.DUMB SHOW.Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the restBy many a dern and painful perchOf Pericles the careful search,By the four opposing coignsWhich the world together joins,Is made with all due diligenceThat horse and sail and high expenseCan stead the quest. At last from Tyre,Fame answering the most strange inquire,To the court of King SimonidesAre letters brought, the tenor these:Antiochus and his daughter dead;The men of Tyrus on the headOf Helicanus would set onThe crown of Tyre, but he will none:The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;Says to 'em, if King PericlesCome not home in twice six moons,He, obedient to their dooms,Will take the crown. The sum of this,Brought hither to Pentapolis,Y-ravished the regions round,And every one with claps can sound,'Our heir-apparent is a king!Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:His queen with child makes her desire--Which who shall cross?--along to go:Omit we all their dole and woe:Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,And so to sea. Their vessel shakesOn Neptune's billow; half the floodHath their keel cut: but fortune's moodVaries again; the grisly northDisgorges such a tempest forth,That, as a duck for life that dives,So up and down the poor ship drives:The lady shrieks, and well-a-nearDoes fall in travail with her fear:And what ensues in this fell stormShall for itself itself perform.I nill relate, action mayConveniently the rest convey;Which might not what by me is told.In your imagination holdThis stage the ship, upon whose deckThe sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.ExitSCENE I:Enter PERICLES, on shipboardPERICLESThou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hastUpon the winds command, bind them in brass,Having call'd them from the deep! O, stillThy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quenchThy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistleIs as a whisper in the ears of death,Unheard.

We here belowRecall not what we give, and therein mayUse honour with you.LYCHORIDAPatience, good sir,Even for this charge.PERICLESNow, mild may be thy life!For a more blustrous birth had never babe:Quiet and gentle thy conditions! forThou art the rudeliest welcome to this worldThat ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!Thou hast as chiding a nativityAs fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,To herald thee from the womb: even at the firstThy loss is more than can thy portage quit,With all thou canst find here. Now, the good godsThrow their best eyes upon't!Enter two SailorsFirst SailorWhat courage, sir? God save you!PERICLESCourage enough: I do not fear the flaw;It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the loveOf this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,I would it would be quiet.First SailorSlack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?Blow, and split thyself.Second SailorBut sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kissthe moon, I care not.First SailorSir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship becleared of the dead.PERICLESThat's your superstition.First SailorPardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been stillobserved: and we are strong in custom. Thereforebriefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.PERICLESAs you think meet. Most wretched queen!LYCHORIDAHere she lies, sir.PERICLESA terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;No light, no fire: the unfriendly elementsForgot thee utterly: nor have I timeTo give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straightMust cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;Where, for a monument upon thy bones,And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whaleAnd humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,My casket and my jewels; and bid NicanderBring me the satin coffer: lay the babeUpon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I sayA priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.Exit LYCHORIDASecond SailorSir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulkedand bitumed ready.PERICLESI thank thee.

'Tis known, I everHave studied physic, through which secret art,By turning o'er authorities, I have,Together with my practise, made familiarTo me and to my aid the blest infusionsThat dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;And I can speak of the disturbancesThat nature works, and of her cures; which doth give meA more content in course of true delightThan to be thirsty after tottering honour,Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,To please the fool and death.Second GentlemanYour honour has through Ephesus pour'd forthYour charity, and hundreds call themselvesYour creatures, who by you have been restored:And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but evenYour purse, still open, hath built Lord CerimonSuch strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.Enter two or three Servants with a chestFirst ServantSo; lift there.CERIMONWhat is that?First ServantSir, even nowDid the sea toss upon our shore this chest:'Tis of some wreck.CERIMONSet 't down, let's look upon't.Second Gentleman'Tis like a coffin, sir.CERIMONWhate'er it be,'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.Second Gentleman'Tis so, my lord.CERIMONHow close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!Did the sea cast it up?First ServantI never saw so huge a billow, sir,As toss'd it upon shore.CERIMONWrench it open;Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.Second GentlemanA delicate odour.CERIMONAs ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!First GentlemanMost strange!CERIMONShrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasuredWith full bags of spices! A passport too!Apollo, perfect me in the characters!Reads from a scroll'Here I give to understand,If e'er this coffin drive a-land,I, King Pericles, have lostThis queen, worth all our mundane cost.Who finds her, give her burying;She was the daughter of a king:Besides this treasure for a fee,The gods requite his charity!'If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heartThat even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.Second GentlemanMost likely, sir.CERIMONNay, certainly to-night;For look how fresh she looks! They were too roughThat threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.Exit a ServantDeath may usurp on nature many hours,And yet the fire of life kindle againThe o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an EgyptianThat had nine hours lien dead,Who was by good appliance recovered.Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fireWell said, well said; the fire and cloths.The rough and woeful music that we have,Cause it to sound, beseech you.The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!The music there!--I pray you, give her air.Gentlemen.This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmthBreathes out of her: she hath not been entrancedAbove five hours: see how she gins to blowInto life's flower again!First GentlemanThe heavens,Through you, increase our wonder and set upYour fame forever.CERIMONShe is alive; behold,Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewelsWhich Pericles hath lost,Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;The diamonds of a most praised waterDo appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,Rare as you seem to be.She movesTHAISAO dear Diana,Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?Second GentlemanIs not this strange?First GentlemanMost rare.CERIMONHush, my gentle neighbours!Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;And AEsculapius guide us!Exeunt, carrying her awaySCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.Enter PERICLES, CLEON, DIONYZA, and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her armsPERICLESMost honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus standsIn a litigious peace. You, and your lady,Take from my heart all thankfulness! The godsMake up the rest upon you!CLEONYour shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,Yet glance full wanderingly on us.DIONYZAO your sweet queen!That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,To have bless'd mine eyes with her!PERICLESWe cannot but obeyThe powers above us. Could I rage and roarAs doth the sea she lies in, yet the endMust be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,For she was born at sea, I have named so, hereI charge your charity withal, leaving herThe infant of your care; beseeching youTo give her princely training, that she may beManner'd as she is born.CLEONFear not, my lord, but thinkYour grace, that fed my country with your corn,For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,Must in your child be thought on. If neglectionShould therein make me vile, the common body,By you relieved, would force me to my duty:But if to that my nature need a spur,The gods revenge it upon me and mine,To the end of generation!PERICLESI believe you;Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,By bright Diana, whom we honour, allUnscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.Good madam, make me blessed in your careIn bringing up my child.DIONYZAI have one myself,Who shall not be more dear to my respectThan yours, my lord.PERICLESMadam, my thanks and prayers.CLEONWe'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune andThe gentlest winds of heaven.PERICLESI will embraceYour offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,Lychorida, no tears:Look to your little mistress, on whose graceYou may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.ExeuntSCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.Enter CERIMON and THAISACERIMONMadam, this letter, and some certain jewels,Lay with you in your coffer: which are nowAt your command. Know you the character?THAISAIt is my lord's.That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,Even on my eaning time; but whether thereDeliver'd, by the holy gods,I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,A vestal livery will I take me to,And never more have joy.CERIMONMadam, if this you purpose as ye speak,Diana's temple is not distant far,Where you may abide till your date expire.Moreover, if you please, a niece of mineShall there attend you.THAISAMy recompense is thanks, that's all;Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.ExeuntACT IVEnter GOWERGOWERImagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,Welcomed and settled to his own desire.His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,Unto Diana there a votaress.Now to Marina bend your mind,Whom our fast-growing scene must findAt Tarsus, and by Cleon train'dIn music, letters; who hath gain'dOf education all the grace,Which makes her both the heart and placeOf general wonder. But, alack,That monster envy, oft the wrackOf earned praise, Marina's lifeSeeks to take off by treason's knife.And in this kind hath our CleonOne daughter, and a wench full grown,Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maidHight Philoten: and it is saidFor certain in our story, sheWould ever with Marina be:Be't when she weaved the sleided silkWith fingers long, small, white as milk;Or when she would with sharp needle woundThe cambric, which she made more soundBy hurting it; or when to the luteShe sung, and made the night-bird mute,That still records with moan; or whenShe would with rich and constant penVail to her mistress Dian; stillThis Philoten contends in skillWith absolute Marina: soWith the dove of Paphos might the crowVie feathers white. Marina getsAll praises, which are paid as debts,And not as given. This so darksIn Philoten all graceful marks,That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,A present murderer does prepareFor good Marina, that her daughterMight stand peerless by this slaughter.The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:And cursed Dionyza hathThe pregnant instrument of wrathPrest for this blow. The unborn eventI do commend to your content:Only I carry winged timePost on the lame feet of my rhyme;Which never could I so convey,Unless your thoughts went on my way.Dionyza does appear,With Leonine, a murderer.ExitSCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.Enter DIONYZA and LEONINEDIONYZAThy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, whichEven women have cast off, melt thee, but beA soldier to thy purpose.LEONINEI will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.DIONYZAThe fitter, then, the gods should have her. Hereshe comes weeping for her only mistress' death.Thou art resolved?LEONINEI am resolved.Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowersMARINANo, I will rob Tellus of her weed,To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,The purple violets, and marigolds,Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,Born in a tempest, when my mother died,This world to me is like a lasting storm,Whirring me from my friends.DIONYZAHow now, Marina! why do you keep alone?How chance my daughter is not with you? Do notConsume your blood with sorrowing: you haveA nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changedWith this unprofitable woe!Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.MARINANo, I pray you;I'll not bereave you of your servant.DIONYZACome, come;I love the king your father, and yourself,With more than foreign heart. We every dayExpect him here: when he shall come and findOur paragon to all reports thus blasted,He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;Blame both my lord and me, that we have takenNo care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserveThat excellent complexion, which did stealThe eyes of young and old. Care not for meI can go home alone.MARINAWell, I will go;But yet I have no desire to it.DIONYZACome, come, I know 'tis good for you.Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:Remember what I have said.LEONINEI warrant you, madam.DIONYZAI'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:What! I must have a care of you.MARINAMy thanks, sweet madam.Exit DIONYZAIs this wind westerly that blows?LEONINESouth-west.MARINAWhen I was born, the wind was north.LEONINEWas't so?MARINAMy father, as nurse said, did never fear,But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, gallingHis kingly hands, haling ropes;And, clasping to the mast, endured a seaThat almost burst the deck.LEONINEWhen was this?MARINAWhen I was born:Never was waves nor wind more violent;And from the ladder-tackle washes offA canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'And with a dropping industry they skipFrom stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, andThe master calls, and trebles their confusion.LEONINECome, say your prayers.MARINAWhat mean you?LEONINEIf you require a little space for prayer,I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,For the gods are quick of ear, and I am swornTo do my work with haste.MARINAWhy will you kill me?LEONINETo satisfy my lady.MARINAWhy would she have me kill'd?Now, as I can remember, by my troth,I never did her hurt in all my life:I never spake bad word, nor did ill turnTo any living creature: believe me, la,I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:I trod upon a worm against my will,But I wept for it. How have I offended,Wherein my death might yield her any profit,Or my life imply her any danger?LEONINEMy commissionIs not to reason of the deed, but do it.MARINAYou will not do't for all the world, I hope.You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshowYou have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:Your lady seeks my life; come you between,And save poor me, the weaker.LEONINEI am sworn,And will dispatch.He seizes herEnter PiratesFirst PirateHold, villain!LEONINE runs awaySecond PirateA prize! a prize!Third PirateHalf-part, mates, half-part.Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.Exeunt Pirates with MARINARe-enter LEONINELEONINEThese roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;And they have seized Marina. Let her go:There's no hope she will return. I'll swearshe's dead,And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,Not carry her aboard. If she remain,Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.ExitSCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULTPandarBoult!BOULTSir?PandarSearch the market narrowly; Mytilene is full ofgallants. We lost too much money this mart by beingtoo wenchless.BawdWe were never so much out of creatures. We have butpoor three, and they can do no more than they cando; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.PandarTherefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay forthem. If there be not a conscience to be used inevery trade, we shall never prosper.BawdThou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poorbastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--BOULTAy, to eleven; and brought them down again. Butshall I search the market?BawdWhat else, man? The stuff we have, a strong windwill blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.PandarThou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, thatlay with the little baggage.BOULTAy, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meatfor worms. But I'll go search the market.ExitPandarThree or four thousand chequins were as pretty aproportion to live quietly, and so give over.BawdWhy to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to getwhen we are old?PandarO, our credit comes not in like the commodity, northe commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,if in our youths we could pick up some prettyestate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the godswill be strong with us for giving over.BawdCome, other sorts offend as well as we.PandarAs well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.Neither is our profession any trade; it's nocalling. But here comes Boult.Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINABOULT[To MARINA] Come your ways. My masters, you sayshe's a virgin?First PirateO, sir, we doubt it not.BOULTMaster, I have gone through for this piece, you see:if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.BawdBoult, has she any qualities?BOULTShe has a good face, speaks well, and has excellentgood clothes: there's no further necessity ofqualities can make her be refused.BawdWhat's her price, Boult?BOULTI cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.PandarWell, follow me, my masters, you shall have yourmoney presently. Wife, take her in; instruct herwhat she has to do, that she may not be raw in herentertainment.Exeunt Pandar and PiratesBawdBoult, take you the marks of her, the colour of herhair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of hervirginity; and cry 'He that will give most shallhave her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheapthing, if men were as they have been. Get this doneas I command you.BOULTPerformance shall follow.ExitMARINAAlack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown meFor to seek my mother!BawdWhy lament you, pretty one?MARINAThat I am pretty.BawdCome, the gods have done their part in you.MARINAI accuse them not.BawdYou are light into my hands, where you are like to live.MARINAThe more my faultTo scape his hands where I was like to die.BawdAy, and you shall live in pleasure.MARINANo.BawdYes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of allfashions: you shall fare well; you shall have thedifference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?MARINAAre you a woman?BawdWhat would you have me be, an I be not a woman?MARINAAn honest woman, or not a woman.BawdMarry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall havesomething to do with you. Come, you're a youngfoolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would haveyou.MARINAThe gods defend me!BawdIf it please the gods to defend you by men, then menmust comfort you, men must feed you, men must stiryou up. Boult's returned.Re-enter BOULTNow, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?BOULTI have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;I have drawn her picture with my voice.BawdAnd I prithee tell me, how dost thou find theinclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?BOULT'Faith, they listened to me as they would havehearkened to their father's testament. There was aSpaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed toher very description.BawdWe shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.BOULTTo-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know theFrench knight that cowers i' the hams?BawdWho, Monsieur Veroles?BOULTAy, he: he offered to cut a caper at theproclamation; but he made a groan at it, and sworehe would see her to-morrow.BawdWell, well; as for him, he brought his diseasehither: here he does but repair it. I know he willcome in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in thesun.BOULTWell, if we had of every nation a traveller, weshould lodge them with this sign.Bawd[To MARINA] Pray you, come hither awhile. Youhave fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you mustseem to do that fearfully which you commitwillingly, despise profit where you have most gain.To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in yourlovers: seldom but that pity begets you a goodopinion, and that opinion a mere profit.MARINAI understand you not.BOULTO, take her home, mistress, take her home: theseblushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.BawdThou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for yourbride goes to that with shame which is her way to gowith warrant.BOULT'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, ifI have bargained for the joint,--BawdThou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.BOULTI may so.BawdWho should deny it? Come, young one, I like themanner of your garments well.BOULTAy, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.BawdBoult, spend thou that in the town: report what asojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a goodturn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thouhast the harvest out of thine own report.BOULTI warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awakethe beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir upthe lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.BawdCome your ways; follow me.MARINAIf fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.Diana, aid my purpose!BawdWhat have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?ExeuntSCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.Enter CLEON and DIONYZADIONYZAWhy, are you foolish? Can it be undone?CLEONO Dionyza, such a piece of slaughterThe sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!DIONYZAI thinkYou'll turn a child again.CLEONWere I chief lord of all this spacious world,I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princessTo equal any single crown o' the earthI' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!Whom thou hast poison'd too:If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindnessBecoming well thy fact: what canst thou sayWhen noble Pericles shall demand his child?DIONYZAThat she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,To foster it, nor ever to preserve.She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?Unless you play the pious innocent,And for an honest attribute cry out'She died by foul play.'CLEONO, go to. Well, well,Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the godsDo like this worst.DIONYZABe one of those that thinkThe petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,And open this to Pericles. I do shameTo think of what a noble strain you are,And of how coward a spirit.CLEONTo such proceedingWho ever but his approbation added,Though not his prime consent, he did not flowFrom honourable sources.DIONYZABe it so, then:Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.She did disdain my child, and stood betweenHer and her fortunes: none would look on her,But cast their gazes on Marina's face;Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkinNot worth the time of day. It pierced me through;And though you call my course unnatural,You not your child well loving, yet I findIt greets me as an enterprise of kindnessPerform'd to your sole daughter.CLEONHeavens forgive it!DIONYZAAnd as for Pericles,What should he say? We wept after her hearse,And yet we mourn: her monumentIs almost finish'd, and her epitaphsIn glittering golden characters expressA general praise to her, and care in usAt whose expense 'tis done.CLEONThou art like the harpy,Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,Seize with thine eagle's talons.DIONYZAYou are like one that superstitiouslyDoth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:But yet I know you'll do as I advise.ExeuntSCENE IV:Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at TarsusGOWERThus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;Making, to take your imagination,From bourn to bourn, region to region.By you being pardon'd, we commit no crimeTo use one language in each several climeWhere our scenes seem to live. I do beseech youTo learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,The stages of our story. PericlesIs now again thwarting the wayward seas,Attended on by many a lord and knight.To see his daughter, all his life's delight.Old Escanes, whom Helicanus lateAdvanced in time to great and high estate,Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,Old Helicanus goes along behind.Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have broughtThis king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.DUMB SHOW.Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train; CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZASee how belief may suffer by foul show!This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,With sighs shot through, and biggest tearso'ershower'd,Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swearsNever to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bearsA tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.The epitaph is for Marina writBy wicked Dionyza.Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,Who wither'd in her spring of year.She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'No visor does become black villanySo well as soft and tender flattery.Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,And bear his courses to be orderedBy Lady Fortune; while our scene must playHis daughter's woe and heavy well-a-dayIn her unholy service. Patience, then,And think you now are all in Mytilene.ExitSCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.Enter, from the brothel, two GentlemenFirst GentlemanDid you ever hear the like?Second GentlemanNo, nor never shall do in such a place as this, shebeing once gone.First GentlemanBut to have divinity preached there! did you everdream of such a thing?Second GentlemanNo, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:shall's go hear the vestals sing?First GentlemanI'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but Iam out of the road of rutting for ever.ExeuntSCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULTPandarWell, I had rather than twice the worth of her shehad ne'er come here.BawdFie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the godPriapus, and undo a whole generation. We musteither get her ravished, or be rid of her. When sheshould do for clients her fitment, and do me thekindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, herknees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,if he should cheapen a kiss of her.BOULT'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish usof all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.PandarNow, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!Bawd'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by theway to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.BOULTWe should have both lord and lown, if the peevishbaggage would but give way to customers.Enter LYSIMACHUSLYSIMACHUSHow now! How a dozen of virginities?BawdNow, the gods to-bless your honour!BOULTI am glad to see your honour in good health.LYSIMACHUSYou may so; 'tis the better for you that yourresorters stand upon sound legs. How now!wholesome iniquity have you that a man may dealwithal, and defy the surgeon?BawdWe have here one, sir, if she would--but there nevercame her like in Mytilene.LYSIMACHUSIf she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.BawdYour honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.LYSIMACHUSWell, call forth, call forth.BOULTFor flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shallsee a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--LYSIMACHUSWhat, prithee?BOULTO, sir, I can be modest.LYSIMACHUSThat dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than itgives a good report to a number to be chaste.Exit BOULTBawdHere comes that which grows to the stalk; neverplucked yet, I can assure you.Re-enter BOULT with MARINAIs she not a fair creature?LYSIMACHUS'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.Well, there's for you: leave us.BawdI beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, andI'll have done presently.LYSIMACHUSI beseech you, do.Bawd[To MARINA] First, I would have you note, this isan honourable man.MARINAI desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.BawdNext, he's the governor of this country, and a manwhom I am bound to.MARINAIf he govern the country, you are bound to himindeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.BawdPray you, without any more virginal fencing, willyou use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.MARINAWhat he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.LYSIMACHUSHa' you done?BawdMy lord, she's not paced yet: you must take somepains to work her to your manage. Come, we willleave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULTLYSIMACHUSNow, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?MARINAWhat trade, sir?LYSIMACHUSWhy, I cannot name't but I shall offend.MARINAI cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.LYSIMACHUSHow long have you been of this profession?MARINAE'er since I can remember.LYSIMACHUSDid you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester atfive or at seven?MARINAEarlier too, sir, if now I be one.LYSIMACHUSWhy, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be acreature of sale.MARINADo you know this house to be a place of such resort,and will come into 't? I hear say you are ofhonourable parts, and are the governor of this place.LYSIMACHUSWhy, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?MARINAWho is my principal?LYSIMACHUSWhy, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and rootsof shame and iniquity. O, you have heard somethingof my power, and so stand aloof for more seriouswooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, myauthority shall not see thee, or else look friendlyupon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:come, come.MARINAIf you were born to honour, show it now;If put upon you, make the judgment goodThat thought you worthy of it.LYSIMACHUSHow's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.MARINAFor me,That am a maid, though most ungentle fortuneHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,O, that the godsWould set me free from this unhallow'd place,Though they did change me to the meanest birdThat flies i' the purer air!LYSIMACHUSI did not thinkThou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:Persever in that clear way thou goest,And the gods strengthen thee!MARINAThe good gods preserve you!LYSIMACHUSFor me, be you thoughtenThat I came with no ill intent; for to meThe very doors and windows savour vilely.Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, andI doubt not but thy training hath been noble.Hold, here's more gold for thee.A curse upon him, die he like a thief,That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dostHear from me, it shall be for thy good.Re-enter BOULTBOULTI beseech your honour, one piece for me.LYSIMACHUSAvaunt, thou damned door-keeper!Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!ExitBOULTHow's this? We must take another course with you.If your peevish chastity, which is not worth abreakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded likea spaniel. Come your ways.MARINAWhither would you have me?BOULTI must have your maidenhead taken off, or the commonhangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'llhave no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.Re-enter BawdBawdHow now! what's the matter?BOULTWorse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holywords to the Lord Lysimachus.BawdO abominable!BOULTShe makes our profession as it were to stink aforethe face of the gods.BawdMarry, hang her up for ever!BOULTThe nobleman would have dealt with her like anobleman, and she sent him away as cold as asnowball; saying his prayers too.BawdBoult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.BOULTAn if she were a thornier piece of ground than sheis, she shall be ploughed.MARINAHark, hark, you gods!BawdShe conjures: away with her! Would she had nevercome within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's bornto undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!ExitBOULTCome, mistress; come your ways with me.MARINAWhither wilt thou have me?BOULTTo take from you the jewel you hold so dear.MARINAPrithee, tell me one thing first.BOULTCome now, your one thing.MARINAWhat canst thou wish thine enemy to be?BOULTWhy, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.MARINANeither of these are so bad as thou art,Since they do better thee in their command.Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiendOf hell would not in reputation change:Thou art the damned doorkeeper to everyCoistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;To the choleric fisting of every rogueThy ear is liable; thy food is suchAs hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.BOULTWhat would you have me do? go to the wars, wouldyou? where a man may serve seven years for the lossof a leg, and have not money enough in the end tobuy him a wooden one?MARINADo any thing but this thou doest. EmptyOLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;Serve by indenture to the common hangman:Any of these ways are yet better than this;For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,Would own a name too dear. O, that the godsWould safely deliver me from this place!Here, here's gold for thee.If that thy master would gain by thee,Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:And I will undertake all these to teach.I doubt not but this populous city willYield many scholars.BOULTBut can you teach all this you speak of?MARINAProve that I cannot, take me home again,And prostitute me to the basest groomThat doth frequent your house.BOULTWell, I will see what I can do for thee: if I canplace thee, I will.MARINABut amongst honest women.BOULT'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.But since my master and mistress have bought you,there's no going but by their consent: therefore Iwill make them acquainted with your purpose, and Idoubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.ExeuntACT VEnter GOWERGOWERMarina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chancesInto an honest house, our story says.She sings like one immortal, and she dancesAs goddess-like to her admired lays;Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composesNature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,That even her art sisters the natural roses;Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:That pupils lacks she none of noble race,Who pour their bounty on her; and her gainShe gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;And to her father turn our thoughts again,Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrivedHere where his daughter dwells; and on this coastSuppose him now at anchor. The city strivedGod Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whenceLysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;And to him in his barge with fervor hies.In your supposing once more put your sightOf heavy Pericles; think this his bark:Where what is done in action, more, if might,Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.ExitSCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A closepavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLESwithin it, reclined on a couch. A barge lyingbeside the Tyrian vessel.Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUSTyrian Sailor[To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?he can resolve you.O, here he is.Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,And in it is Lysimachus the governor,Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?HELICANUSThat he have his. Call up some gentlemen.Tyrian SailorHo, gentlemen! my lord calls.Enter two or three GentlemenFirst GentlemanDoth your lordship call?HELICANUSGentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;I pray ye, greet them fairly.The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the bargeEnter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two SailorsTyrian SailorSir,This is the man that can, in aught you would,Resolve you.LYSIMACHUSHail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!HELICANUSAnd you, sir, to outlive the age I am,And die as I would do.LYSIMACHUSYou wish me well.Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,I made to it, to know of whence you are.HELICANUSFirst, what is your place?LYSIMACHUSI am the governor of this place you lie before.HELICANUSSir,Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;A man who for this three months hath not spokenTo any one, nor taken sustenanceBut to prorogue his grief.LYSIMACHUSUpon what ground is his distemperature?HELICANUS'Twould be too tedious to repeat;But the main grief springs from the lossOf a beloved daughter and a wife.LYSIMACHUSMay we not see him?HELICANUSYou may;But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.LYSIMACHUSYet let me obtain my wish.HELICANUSBehold him.PERICLES discoveredThis was a goodly person,Till the disaster that, one mortal night,Drove him to this.LYSIMACHUSSir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!Hail, royal sir!HELICANUSIt is in vain; he will not speak to you.First LordSir,We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,Would win some words of him.LYSIMACHUS'Tis well bethought.She questionless with her sweet harmonyAnd other chosen attractions, would allure,And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,Which now are midway stopp'd:She is all happy as the fairest of all,And, with her fellow maids is now uponThe leafy shelter that abuts againstThe island's side.Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUSHELICANUSSure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omitThat bears recovery's name. But, since your kindnessWe have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech youThat for our gold we may provision have,Wherein we are not destitute for want,But weary for the staleness.LYSIMACHUSO, sir, a courtesyWhich if we should deny, the most just godsFor every graff would send a caterpillar,And so afflict our province. Yet once moreLet me entreat to know at large the causeOf your king's sorrow.HELICANUSSit, sir, I will recount it to you:But, see, I am prevented.Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young LadyLYSIMACHUSO, here isThe lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!Is't not a goodly presence?HELICANUSShe's a gallant lady.LYSIMACHUSShe's such a one, that, were I well assuredCame of a gentle kind and noble stock,I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.Fair one, all goodness that consists in bountyExpect even here, where is a kingly patient:If that thy prosperous and artificial featCan draw him but to answer thee in aught,Thy sacred physic shall receive such payAs thy desires can wish.MARINASir, I will useMy utmost skill in his recovery, ProvidedThat none but I and my companion maidBe suffer'd to come near him.LYSIMACHUSCome, let us leave her;And the gods make her prosperous!MARINA singsLYSIMACHUSMark'd he your music?MARINANo, nor look'd on us.LYSIMACHUSSee, she will speak to him.MARINAHail, sir! my lord, lend ear.PERICLESHum, ha!MARINAI am a maid,My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,My lord, that, may be, hath endured a griefMight equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.Though wayward fortune did malign my state,My derivation was from ancestorsWho stood equivalent with mighty kings:But time hath rooted out my parentage,And to the world and awkward casualtiesBound me in servitude.AsideI will desist;But there is something glows upon my cheek,And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'PERICLESMy fortunes--parentage--good parentage--To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?MARINAI said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,You would not do me violence.PERICLESI do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.You are like something that--What country-woman?Here of these shores?MARINANo, nor of any shores:Yet I was mortally brought forth, and amNo other than I appear.PERICLESI am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a oneMy daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-likeAnd cased as richly; in pace another Juno;Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?MARINAWhere I am but a stranger: from the deckYou may discern the place.PERICLESWhere were you bred?And how achieved you these endowments, whichYou make more rich to owe?MARINAIf I should tell my history, it would seemLike lies disdain'd in the reporting.PERICLESPrithee, speak:Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'stModest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palaceFor the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I willbelieve thee,And make my senses credit thy relationTo points that seem impossible; for thou look'stLike one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camestFrom good descending?MARINASo indeed I did.PERICLESReport thy parentage. I think thou said'stThou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,If both were open'd.MARINASome such thingI said, and said no more but what my thoughtsDid warrant me was likely.PERICLESTell thy story;If thine consider'd prove the thousandth partOf my endurance, thou art a man, and IHave suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost lookLike Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smilingExtremity out of act. What were thy friends?How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.MARINAMy name is Marina.PERICLESO, I am mock'd,And thou by some incensed god sent hitherTo make the world to laugh at me.MARINAPatience, good sir,Or here I'll cease.PERICLESNay, I'll be patient.Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,To call thyself Marina.MARINAThe nameWas given me by one that had some power,My father, and a king.PERICLESHow! a king's daughter?And call'd Marina?MARINAYou said you would believe me;But, not to be a troubler of your peace,I will end here.PERICLESBut are you flesh and blood?Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?And wherefore call'd Marina?MARINACall'd MarinaFor I was born at sea.PERICLESAt sea! what mother?MARINAMy mother was the daughter of a king;Who died the minute I was born,As my good nurse Lychorida hath oftDeliver'd weeping.PERICLESO, stop there a little!AsideThis is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleepDid mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,And never interrupt you.MARINAYou scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.PERICLESI will believe you by the syllableOf what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:How came you in these parts? where were you bred?MARINAThe king my father did in Tarsus leave me;Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,Did seek to murder me: and having woo'dA villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,A crew of pirates came and rescued me;Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?It may be,You think me an impostor: no, good faith;I am the daughter to King Pericles,If good King Pericles be.PERICLESHo, Helicanus!HELICANUSCalls my lord?PERICLESThou art a grave and noble counsellor,Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,What this maid is, or what is like to be,That thus hath made me weep?HELICANUSI know not; butHere is the regent, sir, of MytileneSpeaks nobly of her.LYSIMACHUSShe would never tellHer parentage; being demanded that,She would sit still and weep.PERICLESO Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;Give me a gash, put me to present pain;Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon meO'erbear the shores of my mortality,And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,And found at sea again! O Helicanus,Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loudAs thunder threatens us: this is Marina.What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,For truth can never be confirm'd enough,Though doubts did ever sleep.MARINAFirst, sir, I pray,What is your title?PERICLESI am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me nowMy drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you saidThou hast been godlike perfect,The heir of kingdoms and another likeTo Pericles thy father.MARINAIs it no more to be your daughter thanTo say my mother's name was Thaisa?Thaisa was my mother, who did endThe minute I began.PERICLESNow, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledgeShe is thy very princess. Who is this?HELICANUSSir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,Who, hearing of your melancholy state,Did come to see you.PERICLESI embrace you.Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell himO'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?HELICANUSMy lord, I hear none.PERICLESNone!The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.LYSIMACHUSIt is not good to cross him; give him way.PERICLESRarest sounds! Do ye not hear?LYSIMACHUSMy lord, I hear.MusicPERICLESMost heavenly music!It nips me unto listening, and thick slumberHangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.SleepsLYSIMACHUSA pillow for his head:So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,If this but answer to my just belief,I'll well remember you.Exeunt all but PERICLESDIANA appears to PERICLES as in a visionDIANAMy temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,And do upon mine altar sacrifice.There, when my maiden priests are met together,Before the people all,Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, callAnd give them repetition to the life.Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!Awake, and tell thy dream.DisappearsPERICLESCelestial Dian, goddess argentine,I will obey thee.

So he thrived,That he is promised to be wivedTo fair Marina; but in no wiseTill he had done his sacrifice,As Dian bade: whereto being bound,The interim, pray you, all confound.In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,And wishes fall out as they're will'd.At Ephesus, the temple see,Our king and all his company.That he can hither come so soon,Is by your fancy's thankful doom.ExitSCENE III.

She at TarsusWas nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen yearsHe sought to murder: but her better starsBrought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shoreRiding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,Where, by her own most clear remembrance, sheMade known herself my daughter.THAISAVoice and favour!You are, you are--O royal Pericles!FaintsPERICLESWhat means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!CERIMONNoble sir,If you have told Diana's altar true,This is your wife.PERICLESReverend appearer, no;I threw her overboard with these very arms.CERIMONUpon this coast, I warrant you.PERICLES'Tis most certain.CERIMONLook to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.Early in blustering morn this lady wasThrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed herHere in Diana's temple.PERICLESMay we see them?CERIMONGreat sir, they shall be brought you to my house,Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.THAISAO, let me look!If he be none of mine, my sanctityWill to my sense bend no licentious ear,But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,A birth, and death?PERICLESThe voice of dead Thaisa!THAISAThat Thaisa am I, supposed deadAnd drown'd.PERICLESImmortal Dian!THAISANow I know you better.When we with tears parted Pentapolis,The king my father gave you such a ring.Shows a ringPERICLESThis, this: no more, you gods! your present kindnessMakes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,That on the touching of her lips I mayMelt and no more be seen.

Will you deliverHow this dead queen re-lives?CERIMONI will, my lord.Beseech you, first go with me to my house,Where shall be shown you all was found with her;How she came placed here in the temple;No needful thing omitted.PERICLESPure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! IWill offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,This ornamentMakes me look dismal will I clip to form;And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.THAISALord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,My father's dead.PERICLESHeavens make a star of him!

Here our play has ending.ExitCT IPROLOGUEIn Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of GreeceThe princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,Fraught with the ministers and instrumentsOf cruel war: sixty and nine, that woreTheir crownets regal, from the Athenian bayPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is madeTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immuresThe ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.To Tenedos they come;And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorgeTheir warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plainsThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitchTheir brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,And Antenorides, with massy staplesAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,Sperr up the sons of Troy.Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,Sets all on hazard: and hither am I comeA prologue arm'd, but not in confidenceOf author's pen or actor's voice, but suitedIn like conditions as our argument,To tell you, fair beholders, that our playLeaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,Beginning in the middle, starting thence awayTo what may be digested in a play.Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUSTROILUSCall here my varlet; I'll unarm again:Why should I war without the walls of Troy,That find such cruel battle here within?Each Trojan that is master of his heart,Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.PANDARUSWill this gear ne'er be mended?TROILUSThe Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;But I am weaker than a woman's tear,Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,Less valiant than the virgin in the nightAnd skilless as unpractised infancy.PANDARUSWell, I have told you enough of this: for my part,I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that willhave a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.TROILUSHave I not tarried?PANDARUSAy, the grinding; but you must tarrythe bolting.TROILUSHave I not tarried?PANDARUSAy, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.TROILUSStill have I tarried.PANDARUSAy, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, theheating of the oven and the baking; nay, you muststay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.TROILUSPatience herself, what goddess e'er she be,Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.At Priam's royal table do I sit;And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?PANDARUSWell, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I sawher look, or any woman else.TROILUSI was about to tell thee:--when my heart,As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.PANDARUSAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--well, go to--there were no more comparison betweenthe women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; Iwould not, as they term it, praise her: but I wouldsomebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. Iwill not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--TROILUSO Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,Reply not in how many fathoms deepThey lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am madIn Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heartHer eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,In whose comparison all whites are ink,Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizureThe cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of senseHard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given meThe knife that made it.PANDARUSI speak no more than truth.TROILUSThou dost not speak so much.PANDARUSFaith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she benot, she has the mends in her own hands.TROILUSGood Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!PANDARUSI have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on ofher and ill-thought on of you; gone between andbetween, but small thanks for my labour.TROILUSWhat, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?PANDARUSBecause she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fairas Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be asfair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what careI? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.TROILUSSay I she is not fair?PANDARUSI do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool tostay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and soI'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.TROILUSPandarus,--PANDARUSNot I.TROILUSSweet Pandarus,--PANDARUSPray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as Ifound it, and there an end.Exit PANDARUS. An alarumTROILUSPeace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,When with your blood you daily paint her thus.I cannot fight upon this argument;It is too starved a subject for my sword.But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:Between our Ilium and where she resides,Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,Ourself the merchant, and this sailing PandarOur doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.Alarum. Enter AENEASAENEASHow now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?TROILUSBecause not there: this woman's answer sorts,For womanish it is to be from thence.What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?AENEASThat Paris is returned home and hurt.TROILUSBy whom, AEneas?AENEASTroilus, by Menelaus.TROILUSLet Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.AlarumAENEASHark, what good sport is out of town to-day!TROILUSBetter at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?AENEASIn all swift haste.TROILUSCome, go we then together.ExeuntSCENE II. The Same. A street.Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDERCRESSIDAWho were those went by?ALEXANDERQueen Hecuba and Helen.CRESSIDAAnd whither go they?ALEXANDERUp to the eastern tower,Whose height commands as subject all the vale,To see the battle. Hector, whose patienceIs, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,And, like as there were husbandry in war,Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,And to the field goes he; where every flowerDid, as a prophet, weep what it foresawIn Hector's wrath.CRESSIDAWhat was his cause of anger?ALEXANDERThe noise goes, this: there is among the GreeksA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;They call him Ajax.CRESSIDAGood; and what of him?ALEXANDERThey say he is a very man per se,And stands alone.CRESSIDASo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.ALEXANDERThis man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of theirparticular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a maninto whom nature hath so crowded humours that hisvalour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced withdiscretion: there is no man hath a virtue that hehath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but hecarries some stain of it: he is melancholy withoutcause, and merry against the hair: he hath thejoints of every thing, but everything so out of jointthat he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.CRESSIDABut how should this man, that makesme smile, make Hector angry?ALEXANDERThey say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle andstruck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hathever since kept Hector fasting and waking.CRESSIDAWho comes here?ALEXANDERMadam, your uncle Pandarus.Enter PANDARUSCRESSIDAHector's a gallant man.ALEXANDERAs may be in the world, lady.PANDARUSWhat's that? what's that?CRESSIDAGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.PANDARUSGood morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? Whenwere you at Ilium?CRESSIDAThis morning, uncle.PANDARUSWhat were you talking of when I came? Was Hectorarmed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was notup, was she?CRESSIDAHector was gone, but Helen was not up.PANDARUSEven so: Hector was stirring early.CRESSIDAThat were we talking of, and of his anger.PANDARUSWas he angry?CRESSIDASo he says here.PANDARUSTrue, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll layabout him to-day, I can tell them that: and there'sTroilus will not come far behind him: let them takeheed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.CRESSIDAWhat, is he angry too?PANDARUSWho, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.CRESSIDAO Jupiter! there's no comparison.PANDARUSWhat, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know aman if you see him?CRESSIDAAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.PANDARUSWell, I say Troilus is Troilus.CRESSIDAThen you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.PANDARUSNo, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.CRESSIDA'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.PANDARUSHimself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.CRESSIDASo he is.PANDARUSCondition, I had gone barefoot to India.CRESSIDAHe is not Hector.PANDARUSHimself! no, he's not himself: would a' werehimself! Well, the gods are above; time must friendor end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart werein her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.CRESSIDAExcuse me.PANDARUSHe is elder.CRESSIDAPardon me, pardon me.PANDARUSTh' other's not come to't; you shall tell me anothertale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall nothave his wit this year.CRESSIDAHe shall not need it, if he have his own.PANDARUSNor his qualities.CRESSIDANo matter.PANDARUSNor his beauty.CRESSIDA'Twould not become him; his own's better.PANDARUSYou have no judgment, niece: Helenherself swore th' other day, that Troilus, fora brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--CRESSIDANo, but brown.PANDARUS'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.CRESSIDATo say the truth, true and not true.PANDARUSShe praised his complexion above Paris.CRESSIDAWhy, Paris hath colour enough.PANDARUSSo he has.CRESSIDAThen Troilus should have too much: if she praisedhim above, his complexion is higher than his; hehaving colour enough, and the other higher, is tooflaming a praise for a good complexion. I had aslief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus fora copper nose.PANDARUSI swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.CRESSIDAThen she's a merry Greek indeed.PANDARUSNay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' otherday into the compassed window,--and, you know, hehas not past three or four hairs on his chin,--CRESSIDAIndeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring hisparticulars therein to a total.PANDARUSWhy, he is very young: and yet will he, withinthree pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.CRESSIDAIs he so young a man and so old a lifter?PANDARUSBut to prove to you that Helen loves him: she cameand puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--CRESSIDAJuno have mercy! how came it cloven?PANDARUSWhy, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smilingbecomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.CRESSIDAO, he smiles valiantly.PANDARUSDoes he not?CRESSIDAO yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.PANDARUSWhy, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helenloves Troilus,--CRESSIDATroilus will stand to the proof, if you'llprove it so.PANDARUSTroilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteeman addle egg.CRESSIDAIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idlehead, you would eat chickens i' the shell.PANDARUSI cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickledhis chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, Imust needs confess,--CRESSIDAWithout the rack.PANDARUSAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.CRESSIDAAlas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.PANDARUSBut there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughedthat her eyes ran o'er.CRESSIDAWith mill-stones.PANDARUSAnd Cassandra laughed.CRESSIDABut there was more temperate fire under the pot ofher eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?PANDARUSAnd Hector laughed.CRESSIDAAt what was all this laughing?PANDARUSMarry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.CRESSIDAAn't had been a green hair, I should have laughedtoo.PANDARUSThey laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.CRESSIDAWhat was his answer?PANDARUSQuoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on yourchin, and one of them is white.CRESSIDAThis is her question.PANDARUSThat's true; make no question of that. 'Two andfifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that whitehair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.''Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck'tout, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all therest so laughed, that it passed.CRESSIDASo let it now; for it has been while going by.PANDARUSWell, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.CRESSIDASo I do.PANDARUSI'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twerea man born in April.CRESSIDAAnd I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettleagainst May.A retreat soundedPANDARUSHark! they are coming from the field: shall westand up here, and see them as they pass towardIlium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.CRESSIDAAt your pleasure.PANDARUSHere, here, here's an excellent place; here we maysee most bravely: I'll tell you them all by theirnames as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.CRESSIDASpeak not so loud.AENEAS passesPANDARUSThat's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one ofthe flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but markTroilus; you shall see anon.ANTENOR passesCRESSIDAWho's that?PANDARUSThat's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundestjudgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: ifhe see me, you shall see him nod at me.CRESSIDAWill he give you the nod?PANDARUSYou shall see.CRESSIDAIf he do, the rich shall have more.HECTOR passesPANDARUSThat's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's afellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there'sa countenance! is't not a brave man?CRESSIDAO, a brave man!PANDARUSIs a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look youwhat hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, doyou see? look you there: there's no jesting;there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:there be hacks!CRESSIDABe those with swords?PANDARUSSwords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil cometo him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one'sheart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.PARIS passesLook ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he camehurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will doHelen's heart good now, ha! Would I could seeTroilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.HELENUS passesCRESSIDAWho's that?PANDARUSThat's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That'sHelenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.CRESSIDACan Helenus fight, uncle?PANDARUSHelenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. Imarvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.CRESSIDAWhat sneaking fellow comes yonder?TROILUS passesPANDARUSWhere? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! theprince of chivalry!CRESSIDAPeace, for shame, peace!PANDARUSMark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well uponhim, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, andhis helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er sawthree and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, tochange, would give an eye to boot.CRESSIDAHere come more.Forces passPANDARUSAsses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!porridge after meat! I could live and die i' theeyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eaglesare gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I hadrather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon andall Greece.CRESSIDAThere is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.PANDARUSAchilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.CRESSIDAWell, well.PANDARUS'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? haveyou any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is notbirth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?CRESSIDAAy, a minced man: and then to be baked with no datein the pie, for then the man's date's out.PANDARUSYou are such a woman! one knows not at what ward youlie.CRESSIDAUpon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, todefend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend minehonesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, todefend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at athousand watches.PANDARUSSay one of your watches.CRESSIDANay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of thechiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I wouldnot have hit, I can watch you for telling how I tookthe blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it'spast watching.PANDARUSYou are such another!Enter Troilus's BoyBoySir, my lord would instantly speak with you.PANDARUSWhere?BoyAt your own house; there he unarms him.PANDARUSGood boy, tell him I come.Exit boyI doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.CRESSIDAAdieu, uncle.PANDARUSI'll be with you, niece, by and by.CRESSIDATo bring, uncle?PANDARUSAy, a token from Troilus.CRESSIDABy the same token, you are a bawd.Exit PANDARUSWords, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,He offers in another's enterprise;But more in Troilus thousand fold I seeThan in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:That she was never yet that ever knewLove got so sweet as when desire did sue.Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and othersAGAMEMNONPrinces,What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?The ample proposition that hope makesIn all designs begun on earth belowFails in the promised largeness: cheques and disastersGrow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,Infect the sound pine and divert his grainTortive and errant from his course of growth.Nor, princes, is it matter new to usThat we come short of our suppose so farThat after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;Sith every action that hath gone before,Whereof we have record, trial did drawBias and thwart, not answering the aim,And that unbodied figure of the thoughtThat gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,And call them shames? which are indeed nought elseBut the protractive trials of great JoveTo find persistive constancy in men:The fineness of which metal is not foundIn fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,The wise and fool, the artist and unread,The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,Puffing at all, winnows the light away;And what hath mass or matter, by itselfLies rich in virtue and unmingled.NESTORWith due observance of thy godlike seat,Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall applyThy latest words. In the reproof of chanceLies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,How many shallow bauble boats dare sailUpon her patient breast, making their wayWith those of nobler bulk!But let the ruffian Boreas once enrageThe gentle Thetis, and anon beholdThe strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,Bounding between the two moist elements,Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boatWhose weak untimber'd sides but even nowCo-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,Or made a toast for Neptune. Even soDoth valour's show and valour's worth divideIn storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightnessThe herd hath more annoyance by the breezeThan by the tiger; but when the splitting windMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courageAs roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,And with an accent tuned in selfsame keyRetorts to chiding fortune.ULYSSESAgamemnon,Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.In whom the tempers and the minds of allShould be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.Besides the applause and approbation To which,To AGAMEMNONmost mighty for thy place and sway,To NESTORAnd thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out lifeI give to both your speeches, which were suchAs Agamemnon and the hand of GreeceShould hold up high in brass, and such againAs venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-treeOn which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish earsTo his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.AGAMEMNONSpeak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expectThat matter needless, of importless burden,Divide thy lips, than we are confident,When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,We shall hear music, wit and oracle.ULYSSESTroy, yet upon his basis, had been down,And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,But for these instances.The specialty of rule hath been neglected:And, look, how many Grecian tents do standHollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.When that the general is not like the hiveTo whom the foragers shall all repair,What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.The heavens themselves, the planets and this centreObserve degree, priority and place,Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,Office and custom, in all line of order;And therefore is the glorious planet SolIn noble eminence enthroned and spheredAmidst the other; whose medicinable eyeCorrects the ill aspects of planets evil,And posts, like the commandment of a king,Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planetsIn evil mixture to disorder wander,What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,Divert and crack, rend and deracinateThe unity and married calm of statesQuite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,Which is the ladder to all high designs,Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,The primogenitive and due of birth,Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,But by degree, stand in authentic place?Take but degree away, untune that string,And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meetsIn mere oppugnancy: the bounded watersShould lift their bosoms higher than the shoresAnd make a sop of all this solid globe:Strength should be lord of imbecility,And the rude son should strike his father dead:Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,Between whose endless jar justice resides,Should lose their names, and so should justice too.Then every thing includes itself in power,Power into will, will into appetite;And appetite, an universal wolf,So doubly seconded with will and power,Must make perforce an universal prey,And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,This chaos, when degree is suffocate,Follows the choking.And this neglection of degree it isThat by a pace goes backward, with a purposeIt hath to climb. The general's disdain'dBy him one step below, he by the next,That next by him beneath; so every step,Exampled by the first pace that is sickOf his superior, grows to an envious feverOf pale and bloodless emulation:And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.NESTORMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover'dThe fever whereof all our power is sick.AGAMEMNONThe nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,What is the remedy?ULYSSESThe great Achilles, whom opinion crownsThe sinew and the forehand of our host,Having his ear full of his airy fame,Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tentLies mocking our designs: with him PatroclusUpon a lazy bed the livelong dayBreaks scurril jests;And with ridiculous and awkward action,Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,Thy topless deputation he puts on,And, like a strutting player, whose conceitLies in his hamstring, and doth think it richTo hear the wooden dialogue and sound'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seemingHe acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'dWould seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuffThe large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,As he being drest to some oration.'That's done, as near as the extremest endsOf parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,Arming to answer in a night alarm.'And then, forsooth, the faint defects of ageMust be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sportSir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split allIn pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,Severals and generals of grace exact,Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,Success or loss, what is or is not, servesAs stuff for these two to make paradoxes.NESTORAnd in the imitation of these twain--Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crownsWith an imperial voice--many are infect.Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his headIn such a rein, in full as proud a placeAs broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,To match us in comparisons with dirt,To weaken and discredit our exposure,How rank soever rounded in with danger.ULYSSESThey tax our policy, and call it cowardice,Count wisdom as no member of the war,Forestall prescience, and esteem no actBut that of hand: the still and mental parts,That do contrive how many hands shall strike,When fitness calls them on, and know by measureOf their observant toil the enemies' weight,--Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;So that the ram that batters down the wall,For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,They place before his hand that made the engine,Or those that with the fineness of their soulsBy reason guide his execution.NESTORLet this be granted, and Achilles' horseMakes many Thetis' sons.A tucketAGAMEMNONWhat trumpet? look, Menelaus.MENELAUSFrom Troy.Enter AENEASAGAMEMNONWhat would you 'fore our tent?AENEASIs this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?AGAMEMNONEven this.AENEASMay one, that is a herald and a prince,Do a fair message to his kingly ears?AGAMEMNONWith surety stronger than Achilles' arm'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voiceCall Agamemnon head and general.AENEASFair leave and large security. How mayA stranger to those most imperial looksKnow them from eyes of other mortals?AGAMEMNONHow!AENEASAy;I ask, that I might waken reverence,And bid the cheek be ready with a blushModest as morning when she coldly eyesThe youthful Phoebus:Which is that god in office, guiding men?Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?AGAMEMNONThis Trojan scorns us; or the men of TroyAre ceremonious courtiers.AENEASCourtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,Jove's accord,Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!The worthiness of praise distains his worth,If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:But what the repining enemy commends,That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,transcends.AGAMEMNONSir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?AENEASAy, Greek, that is my name.AGAMEMNONWhat's your affair I pray you?AENEASSir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.AGAMEMNONHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy.AENEASNor I from Troy come not to whisper him:I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,To set his sense on the attentive bent,And then to speak.AGAMEMNONSpeak frankly as the wind;It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,He tells thee so himself.AENEASTrumpet, blow loud,Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;And every Greek of mettle, let him know,What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.Trumpet soundsWe have, great Agamemnon, here in TroyA prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--Who in this dull and long-continued truceIs rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!If there be one among the fair'st of GreeceThat holds his honour higher than his ease,That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,That loves his mistress more than in confession,With truant vows to her own lips he loves,And dare avow her beauty and her worthIn other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,And will to-morrow with his trumpet callMidway between your tents and walls of Troy,To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:If any come, Hector shall honour him;If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worthThe splinter of a lance. Even so much.AGAMEMNONThis shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;If none of them have soul in such a kind,We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,That means not, hath not, or is not in love!If then one is, or hath, or means to be,That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.NESTORTell him of Nestor, one that was a manWhen Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;But if there be not in our Grecian hostOne noble man that hath one spark of fire,To answer for his love, tell him from meI'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaverAnd in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,And meeting him will tell him that my ladyWas fairer than his grandam and as chasteAs may be in the world: his youth in flood,I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.AENEASNow heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!ULYSSESAmen.AGAMEMNONFair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.Achilles shall have word of this intent;So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:Yourself shall feast with us before you goAnd find the welcome of a noble foe.Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTORULYSSESNestor!NESTORWhat says Ulysses?ULYSSESI have a young conception in my brain;Be you my time to bring it to some shape.NESTORWhat is't?ULYSSESThis 'tis:Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded prideThat hath to this maturity blown upIn rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,To overbulk us all.NESTORWell, and how?ULYSSESThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends,However it is spread in general name,Relates in purpose only to Achilles.NESTORThe purpose is perspicuous even as substance,Whose grossness little characters sum up:And, in the publication, make no strain,But that Achilles, were his brain as barrenAs banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purposePointing on him.ULYSSESAnd wake him to the answer, think you?NESTORYes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,That can from Hector bring his honour off,If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;For here the Trojans taste our dear'st reputeWith their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,Our imputation shall be oddly poisedIn this wild action; for the success,Although particular, shall give a scantlingOf good or bad unto the general;And in such indexes, although small pricksTo their subsequent volumes, there is seenThe baby figure of the giant massOf things to come at large. It is supposedHe that meets Hector issues from our choiceAnd choice, being mutual act of all our souls,Makes merit her election, and doth boil,As 'twere from us all, a man distill'dOut of our virtues; who miscarrying,What heart receives from hence the conquering part,To steel a strong opinion to themselves?Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,In no less working than are swords and bowsDirective by the limbs.ULYSSESGive pardon to my speech:Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,The lustre of the better yet to show,Shall show the better. Do not consentThat ever Hector and Achilles meet;For both our honour and our shame in thisAre dogg'd with two strange followers.NESTORI see them not with my old eyes: what are they?ULYSSESWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector,Were he not proud, we all should share with him:But he already is too insolent;A nd we were better parch in Afric sunThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,Why then, we did our main opinion crushIn taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;And, by device, let blockish Ajax drawThe sort to fight with Hector: among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man;For that will physic the great MyrmidonWho broils in loud applause, and make him fallHis crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,Yet go we under our opinion stillThat we have better men. But, hit or miss,Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.NESTORUlysses,Now I begin to relish thy advice;And I will give a taste of it forthwithTo Agamemnon: go we to him straight.Two curs shall tame each other: pride aloneMust tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

Farewell.AJAXFarewell. Who shall answer him?ACHILLESI know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwiseHe knew his man.AJAXO, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.ExeuntSCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUSPRIAMAfter so many hours, lives, speeches spent,Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumedIn hot digestion of this cormorant war--Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?HECTORThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than IAs far as toucheth my particular,Yet, dread Priam,There is no lady of more softer bowels,More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'dThe beacon of the wise, the tent that searchesTo the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:Since the first sword was drawn about this question,Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:If we have lost so many tenths of ours,To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,Had it our name, the value of one ten,What merit's in that reason which deniesThe yielding of her up?TROILUSFie, fie, my brother!Weigh you the worth and honour of a kingSo great as our dread father in a scaleOf common ounces? will you with counters sumThe past proportion of his infinite?And buckle in a waist most fathomlessWith spans and inches so diminutiveAs fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!HELENUSNo marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,You are so empty of them. Should not our fatherBear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,Because your speech hath none that tells him so?TROILUSYou are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;You fur your gloves with reason. Here areyour reasons:You know an enemy intends you harm;You know a sword employ'd is perilous,And reason flies the object of all harm:Who marvels then, when Helenus beholdsA Grecian and his sword, if he do setThe very wings of reason to his heelsAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honourShould have hare-hearts, would they but fattheir thoughtsWith this cramm'd reason: reason and respectMake livers pale and lustihood deject.HECTORBrother, she is not worth what she doth costThe holding.TROILUSWhat is aught, but as 'tis valued?HECTORBut value dwells not in particular will;It holds his estimate and dignityAs well wherein 'tis precious of itselfAs in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatryTo make the service greater than the godAnd the will dotes that is attributiveTo what infectiously itself affects,Without some image of the affected merit.TROILUSI take to-day a wife, and my electionIs led on in the conduct of my will;My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shoresOf will and judgment: how may I avoid,Although my will distaste what it elected,The wife I chose? there can be no evasionTo blench from this and to stand firm by honour:We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viandsWe do not throw in unrespective sieve,Because we now are full. It was thought meetParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks:Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truceAnd did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshnessWrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your handsAnd cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you nowThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate,And do a deed that fortune never did,Beggar the estimation which you prizedRicher than sea and land? O, theft most base,That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,That in their country did them that disgrace,We fear to warrant in our native place!CASSANDRA[Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!PRIAMWhat noise? what shriek is this?TROILUS'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.CASSANDRA[Within] Cry, Trojans!HECTORIt is Cassandra.Enter CASSANDRA, ravingCASSANDRACry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.HECTORPeace, sister, peace!CASSANDRAVirgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,Add to my clamours! let us pay betimesA moiety of that mass of moan to come.Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.ExitHECTORNow, youthful Troilus, do not these high strainsOf divination in our sister workSome touches of remorse? or is your bloodSo madly hot that no discourse of reason,Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,Can qualify the same?TROILUSWhy, brother Hector,We may not think the justness of each actSuch and no other than event doth form it,Nor once deject the courage of our minds,Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick rapturesCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrelWhich hath our several honours all engagedTo make it gracious. For my private part,I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:And Jove forbid there should be done amongst usSuch things as might offend the weakest spleenTo fight for and maintain!PARISElse might the world convince of levityAs well my undertakings as your counsels:But I attest the gods, your full consentGave wings to my propension and cut offAll fears attending on so dire a project.For what, alas, can these my single arms?What Propugnation is in one man's valour,To stand the push and enmity of thoseThis quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,Were I alone to pass the difficultiesAnd had as ample power as I have will,Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,Nor faint in the pursuit.PRIAMParis, you speakLike one besotted on your sweet delights:You have the honey still, but these the gall;So to be valiant is no praise at all.PARISSir, I propose not merely to myselfThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it;But I would have the soil of her fair rapeWiped off, in honourable keeping her.What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,Now to deliver her possession upOn terms of base compulsion! Can it beThat so degenerate a strain as thisShould once set footing in your generous bosoms?There's not the meanest spirit on our partyWithout a heart to dare or sword to drawWhen Helen is defended, nor none so nobleWhose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamedWhere Helen is the subject; then, I say,Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,The world's large spaces cannot parallel.HECTORParis and Troilus, you have both said well,And on the cause and question now in handHave glozed, but superficially: not muchUnlike young men, whom Aristotle thoughtUnfit to hear moral philosophy:The reasons you allege do more conduceTo the hot passion of distemper'd bloodThan to make up a free determination'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revengeHave ears more deaf than adders to the voiceOf any true decision. Nature cravesAll dues be render'd to their owners: now,What nearer debt in all humanityThan wife is to the husband? If this lawOf nature be corrupted through affection,And that great minds, of partial indulgenceTo their benumbed wills, resist the same,There is a law in each well-order'd nationTo curb those raging appetites that areMost disobedient and refractory.If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,As it is known she is, these moral lawsOf nature and of nations speak aloudTo have her back return'd: thus to persistIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong,But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinionIs this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,My spritely brethren, I propend to youIn resolution to keep Helen still,For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependanceUpon our joint and several dignities.TROILUSWhy, there you touch'd the life of our design:Were it not glory that we more affectedThan the performance of our heaving spleens,I would not wish a drop of Trojan bloodSpent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,She is a theme of honour and renown,A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,Whose present courage may beat down our foes,And fame in time to come canonize us;For, I presume, brave Hector would not loseSo rich advantage of a promised gloryAs smiles upon the forehead of this actionFor the wide world's revenue.HECTORI am yours,You valiant offspring of great Priamus.I have a roisting challenge sent amongstThe dun and factious nobles of the GreeksWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:I was advertised their great general slept,Whilst emulation in the army crept:This, I presume, will wake him.ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.Enter THERSITES, solusTHERSITESHow now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth ofthy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? Hebeats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn toconjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue ofmy spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, arare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these twoundermine it, the walls will stand till they fall ofthemselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thycaduceus, if ye take not that little, little lessthan little wit from them that they have! whichshort-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundantscarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a flyfrom a spider, without drawing their massy irons andcutting the web. After this, the vengeance on thewhole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,methinks, is the curse dependent on those that warfor a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envysay Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!Enter PATROCLUSPATROCLUSWho's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.THERSITESIf I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thouwouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: butit is no matter; thyself upon thyself!

A word, my lord.Takes AGAMEMNON asideNESTORWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at him?ULYSSESAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him.NESTORWho, Thersites?ULYSSESHe.NESTORThen will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.ULYSSESNo, you see, he is his argument that has hisargument, Achilles.NESTORAll the better; their fraction is more our wish thantheir faction: but it was a strong composure a foolcould disunite.ULYSSESThe amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easilyuntie. Here comes Patroclus.Re-enter PATROCLUSNESTORNo Achilles with him.ULYSSESThe elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.PATROCLUSAchilles bids me say, he is much sorry,If any thing more than your sport and pleasureDid move your greatness and this noble stateTo call upon him; he hopes it is no otherBut for your health and your digestion sake,And after-dinner's breath.AGAMEMNONHear you, Patroclus:We are too well acquainted with these answers:But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.Much attribute he hath, and much the reasonWhy we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,Not virtuously on his own part beheld,Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,If you do say we think him over-proudAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greaterThan in the note of judgment; and worthierthan himselfHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,Disguise the holy strength of their command,And underwrite in an observing kindHis humorous predominance; yea, watchHis pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as ifThe passage and whole carriage of this actionRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,That if he overhold his price so much,We'll none of him; but let him, like an engineNot portable, lie under this report:'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:A stirring dwarf we do allowance giveBefore a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.PATROCLUSI shall; and bring his answer presently.ExitAGAMEMNONIn second voice we'll not be satisfied;We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.Exit ULYSSESAJAXWhat is he more than another?AGAMEMNONNo more than what he thinks he is.AJAXIs he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself abetter man than I am?AGAMEMNONNo question.AJAXWill you subscribe his thought, and say he is?AGAMEMNONNo, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, aswise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogethermore tractable.AJAXWhy should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? Iknow not what pride is.AGAMEMNONYour mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues thefairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride ishis own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devoursthe deed in the praise.AJAXI do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.NESTORYet he loves himself: is't not strange?AsideRe-enter ULYSSESULYSSESAchilles will not to the field to-morrow.AGAMEMNONWhat's his excuse?ULYSSESHe doth rely on none,But carries on the stream of his disposeWithout observance or respect of any,In will peculiar and in self-admission.AGAMEMNONWhy will he not upon our fair requestUntent his person and share the air with us?ULYSSESThings small as nothing, for request's sake only,He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,And speaks not to himself but with a prideThat quarrels at self-breath: imagined worthHolds in his blood such swoln and hot discourseThat 'twixt his mental and his active partsKingdom'd Achilles in commotion ragesAnd batters down himself: what should I say?He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of itCry 'No recovery.'AGAMEMNONLet Ajax go to him.Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:'Tis said he holds you well, and will be ledAt your request a little from himself.ULYSSESO Agamemnon, let it not be so!We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makesWhen they go from Achilles: shall the proud lordThat bastes his arrogance with his own seamAnd never suffers matter of the worldEnter his thoughts, save such as do revolveAnd ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'dOf that we hold an idol more than he?No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lordMust not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,As amply titled as Achilles is,By going to Achilles:That were to enlard his fat already prideAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burnsWith entertaining great Hyperion.This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'NESTOR[Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs thevein of him.DIOMEDES[Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks upthis applause!AJAXIf I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.AGAMEMNONO, no, you shall not go.AJAXAn a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:Let me go to him.ULYSSESNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.AJAXA paltry, insolent fellow!NESTORHow he describes himself!AJAXCan he not be sociable?ULYSSESThe raven chides blackness.AJAXI'll let his humours blood.AGAMEMNONHe will be the physician that should be the patient.AJAXAn all men were o' my mind,--ULYSSESWit would be out of fashion.AJAXA' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:shall pride carry it?NESTORAn 'twould, you'ld carry half.ULYSSESA' would have ten shares.AJAXI will knead him; I'll make him supple.NESTORHe's not yet through warm: force him with praises:pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.ULYSSES[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.NESTOROur noble general, do not do so.DIOMEDESYou must prepare to fight without Achilles.ULYSSESWhy, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;I will be silent.NESTORWherefore should you so?He is not emulous, as Achilles is.ULYSSESKnow the whole world, he is as valiant.AJAXA whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!Would he were a Trojan!NESTORWhat a vice were it in Ajax now,--ULYSSESIf he were proud,--DIOMEDESOr covetous of praise,--ULYSSESAy, or surly borne,--DIOMEDESOr strange, or self-affected!ULYSSESThank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of natureThrice famed, beyond all erudition:But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,Let Mars divide eternity in twain,And give him half: and, for thy vigour,Bull-bearing Milo his addition yieldTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confinesThy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;Instructed by the antiquary times,He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:Put pardon, father Nestor, were your daysAs green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,You should not have the eminence of him,But be as Ajax.AJAXShall I call you father?NESTORAy, my good son.DIOMEDESBe ruled by him, Lord Ajax.ULYSSESThere is no tarrying here; the hart AchillesKeeps thicket. Please it our great generalTo call together all his state of war;Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrowWe must with all our main of power stand fast:And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.AGAMEMNONGo we to council.

But,marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemedfriend, your brother Troilus,--HELENMy Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--PANDARUSGo to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself mostaffectionately to you,--HELENYou shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,our melancholy upon your head!PANDARUSSweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.HELENAnd to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.PANDARUSNay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the kingcall for him at supper, you will make his excuse.HELENMy Lord Pandarus,--PANDARUSWhat says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?PARISWhat exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?HELENNay, but, my lord,--PANDARUSWhat says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall outwith you. You must not know where he sups.PARISI'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.PANDARUSNo, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, yourdisposer is sick.PARISWell, I'll make excuse.PANDARUSAy, good my lord.

Sweet lord, who'sa-field to-day?PARISHector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all thegallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,but my Nell would not have it so.

The same. Pandarus' orchard.Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meetingPANDARUSHow now! where's thy master? at my cousinCressida's?BoyNo, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.PANDARUSO, here he comes.Enter TROILUSHow now, how now!TROILUSSirrah, walk off.Exit BoyPANDARUSHave you seen my cousin?TROILUSNo, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banksStaying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,And give me swift transportance to those fieldsWhere I may wallow in the lily-bedsProposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wingsAnd fly with me to Cressid!PANDARUSWalk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.ExitTROILUSI am giddy; expectation whirls me round.The imaginary relish is so sweetThat it enchants my sense: what will it be,When that the watery palate tastes indeedLove's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,For the capacity of my ruder powers:I fear it much; and I do fear besides,That I shall lose distinction in my joys;As doth a battle, when they charge on heapsThe enemy flying.Re-enter PANDARUSPANDARUSShe's making her ready, she'll come straight: youmust be witty now. She does so blush, and fetchesher wind so short, as if she were frayed with asprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiestvillain: she fetches her breath as short as anew-ta'en sparrow.ExitTROILUSEven such a passion doth embrace my bosom:My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;And all my powers do their bestowing lose,Like vassalage at unawares encounteringThe eye of majesty.Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDAPANDARUSCome, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her thatyou have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak toher? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see yourpicture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offenddaylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the airis sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ereI part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all theducks i' the river: go to, go to.TROILUSYou have bereft me of all words, lady.PANDARUSWords pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'llbereave you o' the deeds too, if she call youractivity in question. What, billing again? Here's'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.ExitCRESSIDAWill you walk in, my lord?TROILUSO Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!CRESSIDAWished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!TROILUSWhat should they grant? what makes this prettyabruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweetlady in the fountain of our love?CRESSIDAMore dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.TROILUSFears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.CRESSIDABlind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds saferfooting than blind reason stumbling without fear: tofear the worst oft cures the worse.TROILUSO, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid'spageant there is presented no monster.CRESSIDANor nothing monstrous neither?TROILUSNothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weepseas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinkingit harder for our mistress to devise impositionenough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the willis infinite and the execution confined, that thedesire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.CRESSIDAThey say all lovers swear more performance than theyare able and yet reserve an ability that they neverperform, vowing more than the perfection of ten anddischarging less than the tenth part of one. Theythat have the voice of lions and the act of hares,are they not monsters?TROILUSAre there such? such are not we: praise us as weare tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall gobare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversionshall have a praise in present: we will not namedesert before his birth, and, being born, his additionshall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilusshall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worstshall be a mock for his truth, and what truth canspeak truest not truer than Troilus.CRESSIDAWill you walk in, my lord?Re-enter PANDARUSPANDARUSWhat, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?CRESSIDAWell, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.PANDARUSI thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if heflinch, chide me for it.TROILUSYou know now your hostages; your uncle's word and myfirm faith.PANDARUSNay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,though they be long ere they are wooed, they areconstant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;they'll stick where they are thrown.CRESSIDABoldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and dayFor many weary months.TROILUSWhy was my Cressid then so hard to win?CRESSIDAHard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,With the first glance that ever--pardon me--If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.I love you now; but not, till now, so muchBut I might master it: in faith, I lie;My thoughts were like unbridled children, grownToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,When we are so unsecret to ourselves?But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,Or that we women had men's privilegeOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,For in this rapture I shall surely speakThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness drawsMy very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.TROILUSAnd shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.PANDARUSPretty, i' faith.CRESSIDAMy lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?For this time will I take my leave, my lord.TROILUSYour leave, sweet Cressid!PANDARUSLeave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--CRESSIDAPray you, content you.TROILUSWhat offends you, lady?CRESSIDASir, mine own company.TROILUSYou cannot shun Yourself.CRESSIDALet me go and try:I have a kind of self resides with you;But an unkind self, that itself will leave,To be another's fool. I would be gone:Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.TROILUSWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely.CRESSIDAPerchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;And fell so roundly to a large confession,To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,Or else you love not, for to be wise and loveExceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.TROILUSO that I thought it could be in a woman--As, if it can, I will presume in you--To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;To keep her constancy in plight and youth,Outliving beauty's outward, with a mindThat doth renew swifter than blood decays!Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,That my integrity and truth to youMight be affronted with the match and weightOf such a winnow'd purity in love;How were I then uplifted! but, alas!I am as true as truth's simplicityAnd simpler than the infancy of truth.CRESSIDAIn that I'll war with you.TROILUSO virtuous fight,When right with right wars who shall be most right!True swains in love shall in the world to comeApprove their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,Full of protest, of oath and big compare,Want similes, truth tired with iteration,As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,Yet, after all comparisons of truth,As truth's authentic author to be cited,'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,And sanctify the numbers.CRESSIDAProphet may you be!If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,When time is old and hath forgot itself,When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,And mighty states characterless are gratedTo dusty nothing, yet let memory,From false to false, among false maids in love,Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as falseAs air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,''Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,'As false as Cressid.'PANDARUSGo to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be thewitness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.If ever you prove false one to another, since I havetaken such pains to bring you together, let allpitiful goers-between be called to the world's endafter my name; call them all Pandars; let allconstant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.TROILUSAmen.CRESSIDAAmen.PANDARUSAmen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with abed; which bed, because it shall not speak of yourpretty encounters, press it to death: away!And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens hereBed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHASCALCHASNow, princes, for the service I have done you,The advantage of the time prompts me aloudTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mindThat, through the sight I bear in things to love,I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,From certain and possess'd conveniences,To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me allThat time, acquaintance, custom and conditionMade tame and most familiar to my nature,And here, to do you service, am becomeAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted:I do beseech you, as in way of taste,To give me now a little benefit,Out of those many register'd in promise,Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.AGAMEMNONWhat wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.CALCHASYou have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,I know, is such a wrest in their affairsThat their negotiations all must slack,Wanting his manage; and they will almostGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,And he shall buy my daughter; and her presenceShall quite strike off all service I have done,In most accepted pain.AGAMEMNONLet Diomedes bear him,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall haveWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrowBe answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.DIOMEDESThis shall I undertake; and 'tis a burdenWhich I am proud to bear.Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHASEnter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tentULYSSESAchilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:Please it our general to pass strangely by him,As if he were forgot; and, princes all,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question meWhy such unplausive eyes are bent on him:If so, I have derision medicinable,To use between your strangeness and his pride,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:It may be good: pride hath no other glassTo show itself but pride, for supple kneesFeed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.AGAMEMNONWe'll execute your purpose, and put onA form of strangeness as we pass along:So do each lord, and either greet him not,Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him moreThan if not look'd on. I will lead the way.ACHILLESWhat, comes the general to speak with me?You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.AGAMEMNONWhat says Achilles? would he aught with us?NESTORWould you, my lord, aught with the general?ACHILLESNo.NESTORNothing, my lord.AGAMEMNONThe better.Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTORACHILLESGood day, good day.MENELAUSHow do you? how do you?ExitACHILLESWhat, does the cuckold scorn me?AJAXHow now, Patroclus!ACHILLESGood morrow, Ajax.AJAXHa?ACHILLESGood morrow.AJAXAy, and good next day too.ExitACHILLESWhat mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?PATROCLUSThey pass by strangely: they were used to bendTo send their smiles before them to Achilles;To come as humbly as they used to creepTo holy altars.ACHILLESWhat, am I poor of late?'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,Must fall out with men too: what the declined isHe shall as soon read in the eyes of othersAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,And not a man, for being simply man,Hath any honour, but honour for those honoursThat are without him, as place, riches, favour,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,Do one pluck down another and togetherDie in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoyAt ample point all that I did possess,Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find outSomething not worth in me such rich beholdingAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses;I'll interrupt his reading.How now Ulysses!ULYSSESNow, great Thetis' son!ACHILLESWhat are you reading?ULYSSESA strange fellow hereWrites me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,How much in having, or without or in,Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;As when his virtues shining upon othersHeat them and they retort that heat againTo the first giver.'ACHILLESThis is not strange, Ulysses.The beauty that is borne here in the faceThe bearer knows not, but commends itselfTo others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposedSalutes each other with each other's form;For speculation turns not to itself,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd thereWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.ULYSSESI do not strain at the position,--It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;Who, in his circumstance, expressly provesThat no man is the lord of any thing,Though in and of him there be much consisting,Till he communicate his parts to others:Nor doth he of himself know them for aughtTill he behold them form'd in the applauseWhere they're extended; who, like an arch,reverberatesThe voice again, or, like a gate of steelFronting the sun, receives and renders backHis figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;And apprehended here immediatelyThe unknown Ajax.Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there areMost abject in regard and dear in use!What things again most dear in the esteemAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--An act that very chance doth throw upon him--Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,While some men leave to do!How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!How one man eats into another's pride,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!To see these Grecian lords!--why, even alreadyThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breastAnd great Troy shrieking.ACHILLESI do believe it; for they pass'd by meAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to meGood word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?ULYSSESTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'dAs fast as they are made, forgot as soonAs done: perseverance, dear my lord,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hangQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mailIn monumental mockery. Take the instant way;For honour travels in a strait so narrow,Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;For emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue: if you give way,Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush byAnd leave you hindmost;Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,And farewell goes out sighing. O, let notvirtue seekRemuneration for the thing it was;For beauty, wit,High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,Love, friendship, charity, are subjects allTo envious and calumniating time.One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,Though they are made and moulded of things past,And give to dust that is a little giltMore laud than gilt o'er-dusted.The present eye praises the present object.Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;Since things in motion sooner catch the eyeThan what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,And still it might, and yet it may again,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction.ACHILLESOf this my privacyI have strong reasons.ULYSSESBut 'gainst your privacyThe reasons are more potent and heroical:'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in loveWith one of Priam's daughters.ACHILLESHa! known!ULYSSESIs that a wonder?The providence that's in a watchful stateKnows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.There is a mystery--with whom relationDurst never meddle--in the soul of state;Which hath an operation more divineThan breath or pen can give expressure to:All the commerce that you have had with TroyAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;And better would it fit Achilles muchTo throw down Hector than Polyxena:But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.ExitPATROCLUSTo this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:A woman impudent and mannish grownIs not more loathed than an effeminate manIn time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;They think my little stomach to the warAnd your great love to me restrains you thus:Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton CupidShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,Be shook to air.ACHILLESShall Ajax fight with Hector?PATROCLUSAy, and perhaps receive much honour by him.ACHILLESI see my reputation is at stakeMy fame is shrewdly gored.PATROCLUSO, then, beware;Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:Omission to do what is necessarySeals a commission to a blank of danger;And danger, like an ague, subtly taintsEven then when we sit idly in the sun.ACHILLESGo call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire himTo invite the Trojan lords after the combatTo see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,An appetite that I am sick withal,To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,To talk with him and to behold his visage,Even to my full of view.Enter THERSITESA labour saved!THERSITESA wonder!ACHILLESWhat?THERSITESAjax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.ACHILLESHow so?THERSITESHe must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is soprophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that heraves in saying nothing.ACHILLESHow can that be?THERSITESWhy, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a strideand a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath noarithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:bites his lip with a politic regard, as who shouldsay 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as firein a flint, which will not show without knocking.The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not hisneck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself invain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What thinkyou of this man that takes me for the general? He'sgrown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on bothsides, like a leather jerkin.ACHILLESThou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.THERSITESWho, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes notanswering: speaking is for beggars; he wears histongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: letPatroclus make demands to me, you shall see thepageant of Ajax.ACHILLESTo him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire thevaliant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hectorto come unarmed to my tent, and to procuresafe-conduct for his person of the magnanimousand most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honouredcaptain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,et cetera. Do this.PATROCLUSJove bless great Ajax!THERSITESHum!PATROCLUSI come from the worthy Achilles,--THERSITESHa!PATROCLUSWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--THERSITESHum!PATROCLUSAnd to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.THERSITESAgamemnon!PATROCLUSAy, my lord.THERSITESHa!PATROCLUSWhat say you to't?THERSITESGod b' wi' you, with all my heart.PATROCLUSYour answer, sir.THERSITESIf to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it willgo one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for meere he has me.PATROCLUSYour answer, sir.THERSITESFare you well, with all my heart.ACHILLESWhy, but he is not in this tune, is he?THERSITESNo, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be inhim when Hector has knocked out his brains, I knownot; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apolloget his sinews to make catlings on.ACHILLESCome, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.THERSITESLet me bear another to his horse; for that's the morecapable creature.ACHILLESMy mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;And I myself see not the bottom of it.Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUSTHERSITESWould the fountain of your mind were clear again,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be atick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.ExitACT IVSCENE I. Troy.

Good morrow, Lord AEneas.PARISA valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--Witness the process of your speech, whereinYou told how Diomed, a whole week by days,Did haunt you in the field.AENEASHealth to you, valiant sir,During all question of the gentle truce;But when I meet you arm'd, as black defianceAs heart can think or courage execute.DIOMEDESThe one and other Diomed embraces.Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!But when contention and occasion meet,By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy lifeWith all my force, pursuit and policy.AENEASAnd thou shalt hunt a lion, that will flyWith his face backward.

By Venus' hand I swear,No man alive can love in such a sortThe thing he means to kill more excellently.DIOMEDESWe sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,If to my sword his fate be not the glory,A thousand complete courses of the sun!But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!AENEASWe know each other well.DIOMEDESWe do; and long to know each other worse.PARISThis is the most despiteful gentle greeting,The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.What business, lord, so early?AENEASI was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.PARISHis purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this GreekTo Calchas' house, and there to render him,For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:Let's have your company, or, if you please,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:Rouse him and give him note of our approach.With the whole quality wherefore: I fearWe shall be much unwelcome.AENEASThat I assure you:Troilus had rather Troy were borne to GreeceThan Cressid borne from Troy.PARISThere is no help;The bitter disposition of the timeWill have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.AENEASGood morrow, all.Exit with ServantPARISAnd tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,Myself or Menelaus?DIOMEDESBoth alike:He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,Not making any scruple of her soilure,With such a hell of pain and world of charge,And you as well to keep her, that defend her,Not palating the taste of her dishonour,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:He, like a puling cuckold, would drink upThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;You, like a lecher, out of whorish loinsAre pleased to breed out your inheritors:Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;But he as he, the heavier for a whore.PARISYou are too bitter to your countrywoman.DIOMEDESShe's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:For every false drop in her bawdy veinsA Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scrupleOf her contaminated carrion weight,A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,She hath not given so many good words breathAs for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.PARISFair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:But we in silence hold this virtue well,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.Here lies our way.ExeuntSCENE II.

'tis more than I know, I'llbe sworn: for my own part, I came in late. Whatshould he do here?AENEASWho!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrongere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to befalse to him: do not you know of him, but yet gofetch him hither; go.Re-enter TROILUSTROILUSHow now! what's the matter?AENEASMy lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,My matter is so rash: there is at handParis your brother, and Deiphobus,The Grecian Diomed, and our AntenorDeliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,We must give up to Diomedes' handThe Lady Cressida.TROILUSIs it so concluded?AENEASBy Priam and the general state of Troy:They are at hand and ready to effect it.TROILUSHow my achievements mock me!I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,We met by chance; you did not find me here.AENEASGood, good, my lord; the secrets of natureHave not more gift in taciturnity.Exeunt TROILUS and AENEASPANDARUSIs't possible? no sooner got but lost?

I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poorgentleman! A plague upon Antenor!CRESSIDAGood uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,what's the matter?PANDARUSThou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thouart changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.CRESSIDAO you immortal gods! I will not go.PANDARUSThou must.CRESSIDAI will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;I know no touch of consanguinity;No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near meAs the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,Do to this body what extremes you can;But the strong base and building of my loveIs as the very centre of the earth,Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--PANDARUSDo, do.CRESSIDATear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heartWith sounding Troilus.

The same. Pandarus' house.Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDAPANDARUSBe moderate, be moderate.CRESSIDAWhy tell you me of moderation?The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,And violenteth in a sense as strongAs that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?If I could temporize with my affection,Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,The like allayment could I give my grief.My love admits no qualifying dross;No more my grief, in such a precious loss.PANDARUSHere, here, here he comes.Enter TROILUSAh, sweet ducks!CRESSIDAO Troilus! Troilus!Embracing himPANDARUSWhat a pair of spectacles is here!Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,'--O heart, heavy heart,Why sigh'st thou without breaking?where he answers again,'Because thou canst not ease thy smartBy friendship nor by speaking.'There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast awaynothing, for we may live to have need of such averse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?TROILUSCressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,More bright in zeal than the devotion whichCold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.CRESSIDAHave the gods envy?PANDARUSAy, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.CRESSIDAAnd is it true that I must go from Troy?TROILUSA hateful truth.CRESSIDAWhat, and from Troilus too?TROILUSFrom Troy and Troilus.CRESSIDAIs it possible?TROILUSAnd suddenly; where injury of chancePuts back leave-taking, justles roughly byAll time of pause, rudely beguiles our lipsOf all rejoindure, forcibly preventsOur lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vowsEven in the birth of our own labouring breath:We two, that with so many thousand sighsDid buy each other, must poorly sell ourselvesWith the rude brevity and discharge of one.Injurious time now with a robber's hasteCrams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:As many farewells as be stars in heaven,With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,He fumbles up into a lose adieu,And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,Distasted with the salt of broken tears.AENEAS[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?TROILUSHark! you are call'd: some say the Genius soCries 'come' to him that instantly must die.Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.PANDARUSWhere are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, ormy heart will be blown up by the root.ExitCRESSIDAI must then to the Grecians?TROILUSNo remedy.CRESSIDAA woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!When shall we see again?TROILUSHear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--CRESSIDAI true! how now! what wicked deem is this?TROILUSNay, we must use expostulation kindly,For it is parting from us:I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,For I will throw my glove to Death himself,That there's no maculation in thy heart:But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion inMy sequent protestation; be thou true,And I will see thee.CRESSIDAO, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangersAs infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.TROILUSAnd I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.CRESSIDAAnd you this glove. When shall I see you?TROILUSI will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,To give thee nightly visitation.But yet be true.CRESSIDAO heavens! 'be true' again!TROILUSHear while I speak it, love:The Grecian youths are full of quality;They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:How novelty may move, and parts with person,Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--Makes me afeard.CRESSIDAO heavens! you love me not.TROILUSDie I a villain, then!In this I do not call your faith in questionSo mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:But I can tell that in each grace of theseThere lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devilThat tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.CRESSIDADo you think I will?TROILUSNo.But something may be done that we will not:And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,Presuming on their changeful potency.AENEAS[Within] Nay, good my lord,--TROILUSCome, kiss; and let us part.PARIS[Within] Brother Troilus!TROILUSGood brother, come you hither;And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.CRESSIDAMy lord, will you be true?TROILUSWho, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,I with great truth catch mere simplicity;Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.Fear not my truth: the moral of my witIs 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDESWelcome, Sir Diomed! here is the ladyWhich for Antenor we deliver you:At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,And by the way possess thee what she is.Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safeAs Priam is in Ilion.DIOMEDESFair Lady Cressid,So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,Pleads your fair usage; and to DiomedYou shall be mistress, and command him wholly.TROILUSGrecian, thou dost not use me courteously,To shame the zeal of my petition to theeIn praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praisesAs thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,I'll cut thy throat.DIOMEDESO, be not moved, Prince Troilus:Let me be privileged by my place and message,To be a speaker free; when I am henceI'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worthShe shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'TROILUSCome, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,To our own selves bend we our needful talk.Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDESTrumpet withinPARISHark!

Lady, by your leave.CRESSIDAIn kissing, do you render or receive?PATROCLUSBoth take and give.CRESSIDAI'll make my match to live,The kiss you take is better than you give;Therefore no kiss.MENELAUSI'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.CRESSIDAYou're an odd man; give even or give none.MENELAUSAn odd man, lady! every man is odd.CRESSIDANo, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,That you are odd, and he is even with you.MENELAUSYou fillip me o' the head.CRESSIDANo, I'll be sworn.ULYSSESIt were no match, your nail against his horn.May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?CRESSIDAYou may.ULYSSESI do desire it.CRESSIDAWhy, beg, then.ULYSSESWhy then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,When Helen is a maid again, and his.CRESSIDAI am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.ULYSSESNever's my day, and then a kiss of you.DIOMEDESLady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.Exit with CRESSIDANESTORA woman of quick sense.ULYSSESFie, fie upon her!There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look outAt every joint and motive of her body.O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,That give accosting welcome ere it comes,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughtsTo every ticklish reader! set them downFor sluttish spoils of opportunityAnd daughters of the game.Trumpet withinALLThe Trojans' trumpet.AGAMEMNONYonder comes the troop.Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with AttendantsAENEASHail, all you state of Greece! what shall be doneTo him that victory commands? or do you purposeA victor shall be known? will you the knightsShall to the edge of all extremityPursue each other, or shall be dividedBy any voice or order of the field?Hector bade ask.AGAMEMNONWhich way would Hector have it?AENEASHe cares not; he'll obey conditions.ACHILLES'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,A little proudly, and great deal misprizingThe knight opposed.AENEASIf not Achilles, sir,What is your name?ACHILLESIf not Achilles, nothing.AENEASTherefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:In the extremity of great and little,Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;The one almost as infinite as all,The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seekThis blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.ACHILLESA maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.Re-enter DIOMEDESAGAMEMNONHere is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneasConsent upon the order of their fight,So be it; either to the uttermost,Or else a breath: the combatants being kinHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin.AJAX and HECTOR enter the listsULYSSESThey are opposed already.AGAMEMNONWhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?ULYSSESThe youngest son of Priam, a true knight,Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:His heart and hand both open and both free;For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribesTo tender objects, but he in heat of actionIs more vindicative than jealous love:They call him Troilus, and on him erectA second hope, as fairly built as Hector.Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youthEven to his inches, and with private soulDid in great Ilion thus translate him to me.Alarum. Hector and Ajax fightAGAMEMNONThey are in action.NESTORNow, Ajax, hold thine own!TROILUSHector, thou sleep'st;Awake thee!AGAMEMNONHis blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!DIOMEDESYou must no more.Trumpets ceaseAENEASPrinces, enough, so please you.AJAXI am not warm yet; let us fight again.DIOMEDESAs Hector pleases.HECTORWhy, then will I no more:Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;The obligation of our blood forbidsA gory emulation 'twixt us twain:Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan soThat thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,And this is Trojan; the sinews of this legAll Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's bloodRuns on the dexter cheek, and this sinisterBounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish memberWherein my sword had not impressure madeOf our rank feud: but the just gods gainsayThat any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,My sacred aunt, should by my mortal swordBe drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;Hector would have them fall upon him thus:Cousin, all honour to thee!AJAXI thank thee, HectorThou art too gentle and too free a man:I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear henceA great addition earned in thy death.HECTORNot Neoptolemus so mirable,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st OyesCries 'This is he,' could promise to himselfA thought of added honour torn from Hector.AENEASThere is expectance here from both the sides,What further you will do.HECTORWe'll answer it;The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.AJAXIf I might in entreaties find success--As seld I have the chance--I would desireMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents.DIOMEDES'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great AchillesDoth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.HECTORAEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,And signify this loving interviewTo the expecters of our Trojan part;Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;I will go eat with thee and see your knights.AJAXGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us here.HECTORThe worthiest of them tell me name by name;But for Achilles, mine own searching eyesShall find him by his large and portly size.AGAMEMNONWorthy of arms! as welcome as to oneThat would be rid of such an enemy;But that's no welcome: understand more clear,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husksAnd formless ruin of oblivion;But in this extant moment, faith and troth,Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,Bids thee, with most divine integrity,From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.HECTORI thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.AGAMEMNON[To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, noless to you.MENELAUSLet me confirm my princely brother's greeting:You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.HECTORWho must we answer?AENEASThe noble Menelaus.HECTORO, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.MENELAUSName her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.HECTORO, pardon; I offend.NESTORI have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oftLabouring for destiny make cruel wayThrough ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,Despising many forfeits and subduements,When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,Not letting it decline on the declined,That I have said to some my standers by'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.AENEAS'Tis the old Nestor.HECTORLet me embrace thee, good old chronicle,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.NESTORI would my arms could match thee in contention,As they contend with thee in courtesy.HECTORI would they could.NESTORHa!By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.ULYSSESI wonder now how yonder city standsWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.HECTORI know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,Since first I saw yourself and DiomedIn Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.ULYSSESSir, I foretold you then what would ensue:My prophecy is but half his journey yet;For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,Must kiss their own feet.HECTORI must not believe you:There they stand yet, and modestly I think,The fall of every Phrygian stone will costA drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,And that old common arbitrator, Time,Will one day end it.ULYSSESSo to him we leave it.Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:After the general, I beseech you nextTo feast with me and see me at my tent.ACHILLESI shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,And quoted joint by joint.HECTORIs this Achilles?ACHILLESI am Achilles.HECTORStand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.ACHILLESBehold thy fill.HECTORNay, I have done already.ACHILLESThou art too brief: I will the second time,As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.HECTORO, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;But there's more in me than thou understand'st.Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?ACHILLESTell me, you heavens, in which part of his bodyShall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?That I may give the local wound a nameAnd make distinct the very breach whereoutHector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!HECTORIt would discredit the blest gods, proud man,To answer such a question: stand again:Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantlyAs to prenominate in nice conjectureWhere thou wilt hit me dead?ACHILLESI tell thee, yea.HECTORWert thou an oracle to tell me so,I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;His insolence draws folly from my lips;But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,Or may I never--AJAXDo not chafe thee, cousin:And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:You may have every day enough of HectorIf you have stomach; the general state, I fear,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.HECTORI pray you, let us see you in the field:We have had pelting wars, since you refusedThe Grecians' cause.ACHILLESDost thou entreat me, Hector?To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;To-night all friends.HECTORThy hand upon that match.AGAMEMNONFirst, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;There in the full convive we: afterwards,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shallConcur together, severally entreat him.Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,That this great soldier may his welcome know.Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSESTROILUSMy Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?ULYSSESAt Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,But gives all gaze and bent of amorous viewOn the fair Cressid.TROILUSShall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,After we part from Agamemnon's tent,To bring me thither?ULYSSESYou shall command me, sir.As gentle tell me, of what honour wasThis Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover thereThat wails her absence?TROILUSO, sir, to such as boasting show their scarsA mock is due.

A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other AttendantsAEGEONProceed, Solinus, to procure my fallAnd by the doom of death end woes and all.DUKE SOLINUSMerchant of Syracuse, plead no more;I am not partial to infringe our laws:The enmity and discord which of lateSprung from the rancorous outrage of your dukeTo merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,Who wanting guilders to redeem their livesHave seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.For, since the mortal and intestine jars'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,It hath in solemn synods been decreedBoth by the Syracusians and ourselves,To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,If any born at Ephesus be seenAt any Syracusian marts and fairs;Again: if any Syracusian bornCome to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,Unless a thousand marks be levied,To quit the penalty and to ransom him.Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.AEGEONYet this my comfort: when your words are done,My woes end likewise with the evening sun.DUKE SOLINUSWell, Syracusian, say in brief the causeWhy thou departed'st from thy native homeAnd for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.AEGEONA heavier task could not have been imposedThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable:Yet, that the world may witness that my endWas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.In Syracusa was I born, and wedUnto a woman, happy but for me,And by me, had not our hap been bad.With her I lived in joy; our wealth increasedBy prosperous voyages I often madeTo Epidamnum; till my factor's deathAnd the great care of goods at random leftDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse:From whom my absence was not six months oldBefore herself, almost at fainting underThe pleasing punishment that women bear,Had made provision for her following meAnd soon and safe arrived where I was.There had she not been long, but she becameA joyful mother of two goodly sons;And, which was strange, the one so like the other,As could not be distinguish'd but by names.That very hour, and in the self-same inn,A meaner woman was deliveredOf such a burden, male twins, both alike:Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--I bought and brought up to attend my sons.My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,Made daily motions for our home return:Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,We came aboard.A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,Before the always wind-obeying deepGave any tragic instance of our harm:But longer did we not retain much hope;For what obscured light the heavens did grantDid but convey unto our fearful mindsA doubtful warrant of immediate death;Which though myself would gladly have embraced,Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,Weeping before for what she saw must come,And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,Forced me to seek delays for them and me.And this it was, for other means was none:The sailors sought for safety by our boat,And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:My wife, more careful for the latter-born,Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,Such as seafaring men provide for storms;To him one of the other twins was bound,Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:The children thus disposed, my wife and I,Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;And floating straight, obedient to the stream,Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,Dispersed those vapours that offended us;And by the benefit of his wished light,The seas wax'd calm, and we discoveredTwo ships from far making amain to us,Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!Gather the sequel by that went before.DUKE SOLINUSNay, forward, old man; do not break off so;For we may pity, though not pardon thee.AEGEONO, had the gods done so, I had not nowWorthily term'd them merciless to us!For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,We were encounterd by a mighty rock;Which being violently borne upon,Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;So that, in this unjust divorce of us,Fortune had left to both of us alikeWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdenedWith lesser weight but not with lesser woe,Was carried with more speed before the wind;And in our sight they three were taken upBy fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.At length, another ship had seized on us;And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;And would have reft the fishers of their prey,Had not their bark been very slow of sail;And therefore homeward did they bend their course.Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.DUKE SOLINUSAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,Do me the favour to dilate at fullWhat hath befall'n of them and thee till now.AEGEONMy youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,At eighteen years became inquisitiveAfter his brother: and importuned meThat his attendant--so his case was like,Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--Might bear him company in the quest of him:Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsoughtOr that or any place that harbours men.But here must end the story of my life;And happy were I in my timely death,Could all my travels warrant me they live.DUKE SOLINUSHapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'dTo bear the extremity of dire mishap!Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,Which princes, would they, may not disannul,My soul would sue as advocate for thee.But, though thou art adjudged to the deathAnd passed sentence may not be recall'dBut to our honour's great disparagement,Yet I will favour thee in what I can.Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this dayTo seek thy life by beneficial help:Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.Gaoler, take him to thy custody.GaolerI will, my lord.AEGEONHopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,But to procrastinate his lifeless end.ExeuntSCENE II.

Go bid them let us in.DROMIO OF EPHESUSMaud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,idiot, patch!Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'stfor such store,When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.DROMIO OF EPHESUSWhat patch is made our porter? My master stays inthe street.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest hecatch cold on's feet.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSWho talks within there? ho, open the door!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tellme wherefore.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSWherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come againwhen you may.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSWhat art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my nameis Dromio.DROMIO OF EPHESUSO villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thyname for an ass.LUCE[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are thoseat the gate?DROMIO OF EPHESUSLet my master in, Luce.LUCE[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;And so tell your master.DROMIO OF EPHESUSO Lord, I must laugh!Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?LUCE[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?can you tell?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hastanswered him well.ANTIPHOLUSDo you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?OF EPHESUSLUCE[Within] I thought to have asked you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] And you said no.DROMIO OF EPHESUSSo, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSThou baggage, let me in.LUCE[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?DROMIO OF EPHESUSMaster, knock the door hard.LUCE[Within] Let him knock till it ache.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSYou'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.LUCE[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?ADRIANA[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps allthis noise?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled withunruly boys.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSAre you there, wife? you might have come before.ADRIANA[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.DROMIO OF EPHESUSIf you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.ANGELOHere is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we wouldfain have either.BALTHAZARIn debating which was best, we shall part with neither.DROMIO OF EPHESUSThey stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSThere is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.DROMIO OF EPHESUSYou would say so, master, if your garments were thin.Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSGo fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break yourknave's pate.DROMIO OF EPHESUSA man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out uponthee, hind!DROMIO OF EPHESUSHere's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,let me in.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSWell, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.DROMIO OF EPHESUSA crow without feather? Master, mean you so?For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSGo get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.BALTHAZARHave patience, sir; O, let it not be so!Herein you war against your reputationAnd draw within the compass of suspectThe unviolated honour of your wife.Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,Her sober virtue, years and modesty,Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuseWhy at this time the doors are made against you.Be ruled by me: depart in patience,And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,And about evening come yourself aloneTo know the reason of this strange restraint.If by strong hand you offer to break inNow in the stirring passage of the day,A vulgar comment will be made of it,And that supposed by the common routAgainst your yet ungalled estimationThat may with foul intrusion enter inAnd dwell upon your grave when you are dead;For slander lives upon succession,For ever housed where it gets possession.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSYou have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.I know a wench of excellent discourse,Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:There will we dine. This woman that I mean,My wife--but, I protest, without desert--Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:To her will we to dinner.To AngeloGet you homeAnd fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.ANGELOI'll meet you at that place some hour hence.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSDo so. This jest shall cost me some expense.ExeuntSCENE II.

I havebut lean luck in the match, and yet is she awondrous fat marriage.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEHow dost thou mean a fat marriage?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;and I know not what use to put her to but to make alamp of her and run from her by her own light. Iwarrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn aPoland winter: if she lives till doomsday,she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat complexion is she of?DROMIO OF SYRACUSESwart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half soclean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThat's a fault that water will mend.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat's her name?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that'san ell and three quarters, will not measure her fromhip to hip.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThen she bears some breadth?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:she is spherical, like a globe; I could find outcountries in her.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEIn what part of her body stands Ireland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere Scotland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere France?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEIn her forehead; armed and reverted, making waragainst her heir.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere England?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find nowhiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere Spain?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEFaith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere America, the Indies?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEOh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished withrubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their richaspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent wholearmadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere stood Belgia, the Netherlands?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEOh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, thisdrudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd meDromio; swore I was assured to her; told me whatprivy marks I had about me, as, the mark of myshoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on myleft arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:And, I think, if my breast had not been made offaith and my heart of steel,She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and mademe turn i' the wheel.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEGo hie thee presently, post to the road:An if the wind blow any way from shore,I will not harbour in this town to-night:If any bark put forth, come to the mart,Where I will walk till thou return to me.If every one knows us and we know none,'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEAs from a bear a man would run for life,So fly I from her that would be my wife.ExitANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThere's none but witches do inhabit here;And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.She that doth call me husband, even my soulDoth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,Of such enchanting presence and discourse,Hath almost made me traitor to myself:But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.Enter ANGELO with the chainANGELOMaster Antipholus,--ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEAy, that's my name.ANGELOI know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat is your will that I shall do with this?ANGELOWhat please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEMade it for me, sir!

Then they fledInto this abbey, whither we pursued them:And here the abbess shuts the gates on usAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out,Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy commandLet him be brought forth and borne hence for help.DUKE SOLINUSLong since thy husband served me in my wars,And I to thee engaged a prince's word,When thou didst make him master of thy bed,To do him all the grace and good I could.Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gateAnd bid the lady abbess come to me.I will determine this before I stir.Enter a ServantServantO mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!My master and his man are both broke loose,Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctorWhose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;And ever, as it blazed, they threw on himGreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:My master preaches patience to him and the whileHis man with scissors nicks him like a fool,And sure, unless you send some present help,Between them they will kill the conjurer.ADRIANAPeace, fool! thy master and his man are here,And that is false thou dost report to us.ServantMistress, upon my life, I tell you true;I have not breathed almost since I did see it.He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,To scorch your face and to disfigure you.Cry withinHark, hark!

The COUNT's palace.Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in blackCOUNTESSIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.BERTRAMAnd I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's deathanew: but I must attend his majesty's command, towhom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.LAFEUYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,sir, a father: he that so generally is at all timesgood must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whoseworthiness would stir it up where it wanted ratherthan lack it where there is such abundance.COUNTESSWhat hope is there of his majesty's amendment?LAFEUHe hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whosepractises he hath persecuted time with hope, andfinds no other advantage in the process but only thelosing of hope by time.COUNTESSThis young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill wasalmost as great as his honesty; had it stretched sofar, would have made nature immortal, and deathshould have play for lack of work. Would, for theking's sake, he were living! I think it would bethe death of the king's disease.LAFEUHow called you the man you speak of, madam?COUNTESSHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it washis great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.LAFEUHe was excellent indeed, madam: the king verylately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: hewas skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledgecould be set up against mortality.BERTRAMWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?LAFEUA fistula, my lord.BERTRAMI heard not of it before.LAFEUI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewomanthe daughter of Gerard de Narbon?COUNTESSHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to myoverlooking. I have those hopes of her good thather education promises; her dispositions sheinherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for wherean unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, therecommendations go with pity; they are virtues andtraitors too; in her they are the better for theirsimpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.LAFEUYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.COUNTESS'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praisein. The remembrance of her father never approachesher heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes alllivelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affecta sorrow than have it.HELENAI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.LAFEUModerate lamentation is the right of the dead,excessive grief the enemy to the living.COUNTESSIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excessmakes it soon mortal.BERTRAMMadam, I desire your holy wishes.LAFEUHow understand we that?COUNTESSBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy fatherIn manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtueContend for empire in thee, and thy goodnessShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemyRather in power than use, and keep thy friendUnder thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,Advise him.LAFEUHe cannot want the bestThat shall attend his love.COUNTESSHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.ExitBERTRAM[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged inyour thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortableto my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.LAFEUFarewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit ofyour father.Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEUHELENAO, were that all! I think not on my father;And these great tears grace his remembrance moreThan those I shed for him. What was he like?I have forgot him: my imaginationCarries no favour in't but Bertram's.I am undone: there is no living, none,If Bertram be away. 'Twere all oneThat I should love a bright particular starAnd think to wed it, he is so above me:In his bright radiance and collateral lightMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:The hind that would be mated by the lionMust die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,To see him every hour; to sit and drawHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,In our heart's table; heart too capableOf every line and trick of his sweet favour:But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancyMust sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?Enter PAROLLESAsideOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake;And yet I know him a notorious liar,Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,That they take place, when virtue's steely bonesLook bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we seeCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.PAROLLESSave you, fair queen!HELENAAnd you, monarch!PAROLLESNo.HELENAAnd no.PAROLLESAre you meditating on virginity?HELENAAy. You have some stain of soldier in you: let meask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; howmay we barricado it against him?PAROLLESKeep him out.HELENABut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us somewarlike resistance.PAROLLESThere is none: man, sitting down before you, willundermine you and blow you up.HELENABless our poor virginity from underminers andblowers up! Is there no military policy, howvirgins might blow up men?PAROLLESVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier beblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, withthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. Itis not politic in the commonwealth of nature topreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rationalincrease and there was never virgin got tillvirginity was first lost. That you were made of ismetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lostmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it isever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!HELENAI will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.PAROLLESThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against therule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallibledisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:virginity murders itself and should be buried inhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperateoffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,much like a cheese; consumes itself to the veryparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made ofself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in thecanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but looseby't: out with 't! within ten year it will makeitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and theprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!HELENAHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?PAROLLESLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er itlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss withlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 'twhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap outof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: justlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear notnow. Your date is better in your pie and yourporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,your old virginity, is like one of our Frenchwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?HELENANot my virginity yet [ ]There shall your master have a thousand loves,A mother and a mistress and a friend,A phoenix, captain and an enemy,A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;His humble ambition, proud humility,His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,His faith, his sweet disaster; with a worldOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--I know not what he shall. God send him well!The court's a learning place, and he is one--PAROLLESWhat one, i' faith?HELENAThat I wish well. 'Tis pity--PAROLLESWhat's pity?HELENAThat wishing well had not a body in't,Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,Might with effects of them follow our friends,And show what we alone must think, which neverReturn us thanks.Enter PagePageMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.ExitPAROLLESLittle Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, Iwill think of thee at court.HELENAMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.PAROLLESUnder Mars, I.HELENAI especially think, under Mars.PAROLLESWhy under Mars?HELENAThe wars have so kept you under that you must needsbe born under Mars.PAROLLESWhen he was predominant.HELENAWhen he was retrograde, I think, rather.PAROLLESWhy think you so?HELENAYou go so much backward when you fight.PAROLLESThat's for advantage.HELENASo is running away, when fear proposes the safety;but the composition that your valour and fear makesin you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.PAROLLESI am so full of businesses, I cannot answer theeacutely. I will return perfect courtier; in thewhich, my instruction shall serve to naturalizethee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier'scounsel and understand what advice shall thrust uponthee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, andthine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. Whenthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hastnone, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.ExitHELENAOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated skyGives us free scope, only doth backward pullOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.What power is it which mounts my love so high,That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?The mightiest space in fortune nature bringsTo join like likes and kiss like native things.Impossible be strange attempts to thoseThat weigh their pains in sense and do supposeWhat hath been cannot be: who ever stroveSo show her merit, that did miss her love?The king's disease--my project may deceive me,But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.ExitSCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers AttendantsKINGThe Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;Have fought with equal fortune and continueA braving war.First LordSo 'tis reported, sir.KINGNay, 'tis most credible; we here received itA certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,With caution that the Florentine will move usFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friendPrejudicates the business and would seemTo have us make denial.First LordHis love and wisdom,Approved so to your majesty, may pleadFor amplest credence.KINGHe hath arm'd our answer,And Florence is denied before he comes:Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to seeThe Tuscan service, freely have they leaveTo stand on either part.Second LordIt well may serveA nursery to our gentry, who are sickFor breathing and exploit.KINGWhat's he comes here?Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLESFirst LordIt is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,Young Bertram.KINGYouth, thou bear'st thy father's face;Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral partsMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.BERTRAMMy thanks and duty are your majesty's.KINGI would I had that corporal soundness now,As when thy father and myself in friendshipFirst tried our soldiership! He did look farInto the service of the time and wasDiscipled of the bravest: he lasted long;But on us both did haggish age steal onAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs meTo talk of your good father. In his youthHe had the wit which I can well observeTo-day in our young lords; but they may jestTill their own scorn return to them unnotedEre they can hide their levity in honour;So like a courtier, contempt nor bitternessWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,His equal had awaked them, and his honour,Clock to itself, knew the true minute whenException bid him speak, and at this timeHis tongue obey'd his hand: who were below himHe used as creatures of another placeAnd bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,Making them proud of his humility,In their poor praise he humbled. Such a manMight be a copy to these younger times;Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them nowBut goers backward.BERTRAMHis good remembrance, sir,Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;So in approof lives not his epitaphAs in your royal speech.KINGWould I were with him! He would always say--Methinks I hear him now; his plausive wordsHe scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--This his good melancholy oft began,On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuffOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive sensesAll but new things disdain; whose judgments areMere fathers of their garments; whose constanciesExpire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;I after him do after him wish too,Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,I quickly were dissolved from my hive,To give some labourers room.Second LordYou are loved, sir:They that least lend it you shall lack you first.KINGI fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,Since the physician at your father's died?He was much famed.BERTRAMSome six months since, my lord.KINGIf he were living, I would try him yet.Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me outWith several applications; nature and sicknessDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;My son's no dearer.BERTRAMThank your majesty.Exeunt. FlourishSCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and ClownCOUNTESSI will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?StewardMadam, the care I have had to even your content, Iwish might be found in the calendar of my pastendeavours; for then we wound our modesty and makefoul the clearness of our deservings, when ofourselves we publish them.COUNTESSWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:the complaints I have heard of you I do not allbelieve: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I knowyou lack not folly to commit them, and have abilityenough to make such knaveries yours.Clown'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.COUNTESSWell, sir.ClownNo, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, thoughmany of the rich are damned: but, if I may haveyour ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbelthe woman and I will do as we may.COUNTESSWilt thou needs be a beggar?ClownI do beg your good will in this case.COUNTESSIn what case?ClownIn Isbel's case and mine own. Service is noheritage: and I think I shall never have theblessing of God till I have issue o' my body; forthey say barnes are blessings.COUNTESSTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.ClownMy poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven onby the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.COUNTESSIs this all your worship's reason?ClownFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as theyare.COUNTESSMay the world know them?ClownI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you andall flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marrythat I may repent.COUNTESSThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.ClownI am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to havefriends for my wife's sake.COUNTESSSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.ClownYou're shallow, madam, in great friends; for theknaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.He that ears my land spares my team and gives meleave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's mydrudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisherof my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my fleshand blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves myflesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kissesmy wife is my friend. If men could be contented tobe what they are, there were no fear in marriage;for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam thePapist, howsome'er their hearts are severed inreligion, their heads are both one; they may jowlhorns together, like any deer i' the herd.COUNTESSWilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?ClownA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the nextway:For I the ballad will repeat,Which men full true shall find;Your marriage comes by destiny,Your cuckoo sings by kind.COUNTESSGet you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.StewardMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come toyou: of her I am to speak.COUNTESSSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;Helen, I mean.ClownWas this fair face the cause, quoth she,Why the Grecians sacked Troy?Fond done, done fond,Was this King Priam's joy?With that she sighed as she stood,With that she sighed as she stood,And gave this sentence then;Among nine bad if one be good,Among nine bad if one be good,There's yet one good in ten.COUNTESSWhat, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.ClownOne good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifyingo' the song: would God would serve the world so allthe year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An wemight have a good woman born but one every blazingstar, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lotterywell: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluckone.COUNTESSYou'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.ClownThat man should be at woman's command, and yet nohurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet itwill do no hurt; it will wear the surplice ofhumility over the black gown of a big heart. I amgoing, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.ExitCOUNTESSWell, now.StewardI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.COUNTESSFaith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; andshe herself, without other advantage, may lawfullymake title to as much love as she finds: there ismore owing her than is paid; and more shall be paidher than she'll demand.StewardMadam, I was very late more near her than I thinkshe wished me: alone she was, and did communicateto herself her own words to her own ears; shethought, I dare vow for her, they touched not anystranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had putsuch difference betwixt their two estates; Love nogod, that would not extend his might, only wherequalities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, thatwould suffer her poor knight surprised, withoutrescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.This she delivered in the most bitter touch ofsorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which Iheld my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concernsyou something to know it.COUNTESSYou have discharged this honestly; keep it toyourself: many likelihoods informed me of thisbefore, which hung so tottering in the balance thatI could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank youfor your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.Exit StewardEnter HELENAEven so it was with me when I was young:If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thornDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;It is the show and seal of nature's truth,Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:By our remembrances of days foregone,Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.HELENAWhat is your pleasure, madam?COUNTESSYou know, Helen,I am a mother to you.HELENAMine honourable mistress.COUNTESSNay, a mother:Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;And put you in the catalogue of thoseThat were enwombed mine: 'tis often seenAdoption strives with nature and choice breedsA native slip to us from foreign seeds:You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,Yet I express to you a mother's care:God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy bloodTo say I am thy mother? What's the matter,That this distemper'd messenger of wet,The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?Why? that you are my daughter?HELENAThat I am not.COUNTESSI say, I am your mother.HELENAPardon, madam;The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:I am from humble, he from honour'd name;No note upon my parents, his all noble:My master, my dear lord he is; and IHis servant live, and will his vassal die:He must not be my brother.COUNTESSNor I your mother?HELENAYou are my mother, madam; would you were,--So that my lord your son were not my brother,--Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,I care no more for than I do for heaven,So I were not his sister. Can't no other,But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?COUNTESSYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:God shield you mean it not! daughter and motherSo strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I seeThe mystery of your loneliness, and findYour salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis grossYou love my son; invention is ashamed,Against the proclamation of thy passion,To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeksConfess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyesSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviorsThat in their kind they speak it: only sinAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,Tell me truly.HELENAGood madam, pardon me!COUNTESSDo you love my son?HELENAYour pardon, noble mistress!COUNTESSLove you my son?HELENADo not you love him, madam?COUNTESSGo not about; my love hath in't a bond,Whereof the world takes note: come, come, discloseThe state of your affection; for your passionsHave to the full appeach'd.HELENAThen, I confess,Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,That before you, and next unto high heaven,I love your son.My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:Be not offended; for it hurts not himThat he is loved of me: I follow him notBy any token of presumptuous suit;Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;Yet never know how that desert should be.I know I love in vain, strive against hope;Yet in this captious and intenible sieveI still pour in the waters of my loveAnd lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,Religious in mine error, I adoreThe sun, that looks upon his worshipper,But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,Let not your hate encounter with my loveFor loving where you do: but if yourself,Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,Did ever in so true a flame of likingWish chastely and love dearly, that your DianWas both herself and love: O, then, give pityTo her, whose state is such that cannot chooseBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;That seeks not to find that her search implies,But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!COUNTESSHad you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--To go to Paris?HELENAMadam, I had.COUNTESSWherefore? tell true.HELENAI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.You know my father left me some prescriptionsOf rare and proved effects, such as his readingAnd manifest experience had collectedFor general sovereignty; and that he will'd meIn heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,As notes whose faculties inclusive wereMore than they were in note: amongst the rest,There is a remedy, approved, set down,To cure the desperate languishings whereofThe king is render'd lost.COUNTESSThis was your motiveFor Paris, was it? speak.HELENAMy lord your son made me to think of this;Else Paris and the medicine and the kingHad from the conversation of my thoughtsHaply been absent then.COUNTESSBut think you, Helen,If you should tender your supposed aid,He would receive it? he and his physiciansAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,They, that they cannot help: how shall they creditA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left offThe danger to itself?HELENAThere's something in't,More than my father's skill, which was the greatestOf his profession, that his good receiptShall for my legacy be sanctifiedBy the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honourBut give me leave to try success, I'ld ventureThe well-lost life of mine on his grace's cureBy such a day and hour.COUNTESSDost thou believe't?HELENAAy, madam, knowingly.COUNTESSWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,Means and attendants and my loving greetingsTo those of mine in court: I'll stay at homeAnd pray God's blessing into thy attempt:Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

But to the court!ClownTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, hemay easily put it off at court: he that cannot makea leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeedsuch a fellow, to say precisely, were not for thecourt; but for me, I have an answer will serve allmen.COUNTESSMarry, that's a bountiful answer that fits allquestions.ClownIt is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawnbuttock, or any buttock.COUNTESSWill your answer serve fit to all questions?ClownAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib'srush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for ShroveTuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to hishole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queento a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to thefriar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.COUNTESSHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for allquestions?ClownFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, itwill fit any question.COUNTESSIt must be an answer of most monstrous size thatmust fit all demands.ClownBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learnedshould speak truth of it: here it is, and all thatbelongs to't.

Sir, will you hear my suit?First LordAnd grant it.HELENAThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.LAFEUI had rather be in this choice than throw ames-acefor my life.HELENAThe honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,Before I speak, too threateningly replies:Love make your fortunes twenty times aboveHer that so wishes and her humble love!Second LordNo better, if you please.HELENAMy wish receive,Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.LAFEUDo all they deny her?

This is the man.KINGWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.BERTRAMMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,In such a business give me leave to useThe help of mine own eyes.KINGKnow'st thou not, Bertram,What she has done for me?BERTRAMYes, my good lord;But never hope to know why I should marry her.KINGThou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.BERTRAMBut follows it, my lord, to bring me downMust answer for your raising? I know her well:She had her breeding at my father's charge.A poor physician's daughter my wife! DisdainRather corrupt me ever!KING'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the whichI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,Would quite confound distinction, yet stand offIn differences so mighty. If she beAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikestOf virtue for the name: but do not so:From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,The place is dignified by the doer's deed:Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,It is a dropsied honour. Good aloneIs good without a name. Vileness is so:The property by what it is should go,Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;In these to nature she's immediate heir,And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,Which challenges itself as honour's bornAnd is not like the sire: honours thrive,When rather from our acts we them deriveThan our foregoers: the mere word's a slaveDebosh'd on every tomb, on every graveA lying trophy, and as oft is dumbWhere dust and damn'd oblivion is the tombOf honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?If thou canst like this creature as a maid,I can create the rest: virtue and sheIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.BERTRAMI cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.KINGThou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.HELENAThat you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:Let the rest go.KINGMy honour's at the stake; which to defeat,I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;That dost in vile misprision shackle upMy love and her desert; that canst not dream,We, poising us in her defective scale,Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,It is in us to plant thine honour whereWe please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:Obey our will, which travails in thy good:Believe not thy disdain, but presentlyDo thine own fortunes that obedient rightWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;Or I will throw thee from my care for everInto the staggers and the careless lapseOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hateLoosing upon thee, in the name of justice,Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.BERTRAMPardon, my gracious lord; for I submitMy fancy to your eyes: when I considerWhat great creation and what dole of honourFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which lateWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is nowThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,Is as 'twere born so.KINGTake her by the hand,And tell her she is thine: to whom I promiseA counterpoise, if not to thy estateA balance more replete.BERTRAMI take her hand.KINGGood fortune and the favour of the kingSmile upon this contract; whose ceremonyShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feastShall more attend upon the coming space,Expecting absent friends.

My master!LAFEUAre you companion to the Count Rousillon?PAROLLESTo any count, to all counts, to what is man.LAFEUTo what is count's man: count's master is ofanother style.PAROLLESYou are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.LAFEUI must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to whichtitle age cannot bring thee.PAROLLESWhat I dare too well do, I dare not do.LAFEUI did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a prettywise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thytravel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and thebannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me frombelieving thee a vessel of too great a burthen. Ihave now found thee; when I lose thee again, I carenot: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; andthat thou't scarce worth.PAROLLESHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--LAFEUDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thouhasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on theefor a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare theewell: thy casement I need not open, for I lookthrough thee. Give me thy hand.PAROLLESMy lord, you give me most egregious indignity.LAFEUAy, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.PAROLLESI have not, my lord, deserved it.LAFEUYes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will notbate thee a scruple.PAROLLESWell, I shall be wiser.LAFEUEven as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull ata smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st boundin thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it isto be proud of thy bondage.

God?PAROLLESAy, sir.LAFEUThe devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thougarter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose ofsleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best setthy lower part where thy nose stands. By minehonour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beatthee: methinks, thou art a general offence, andevery man should beat thee: I think thou wastcreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.PAROLLESThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.LAFEUGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking akernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond andno true traveller: you are more saucy with lordsand honourable personages than the commission of yourbirth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are notworth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.ExitPAROLLESGood, very good; it is so then: good, very good;let it be concealed awhile.Re-enter BERTRAMBERTRAMUndone, and forfeited to cares for ever!PAROLLESWhat's the matter, sweet-heart?BERTRAMAlthough before the solemn priest I have sworn,I will not bed her.PAROLLESWhat, what, sweet-heart?BERTRAMO my Parolles, they have married me!I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.PAROLLESFrance is a dog-hole, and it no more meritsThe tread of a man's foot: to the wars!BERTRAMThere's letters from my mother: what the import is,I know not yet.PAROLLESAy, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!He wears his honour in a box unseen,That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,Spending his manly marrow in her arms,Which should sustain the bound and high curvetOf Mars's fiery steed. To other regionsFrance is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;Therefore, to the war!BERTRAMIt shall be so: I'll send her to my house,Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,And wherefore I am fled; write to the kingThat which I durst not speak; his present giftShall furnish me to those Italian fields,Where noble fellows strike: war is no strifeTo the dark house and the detested wife.PAROLLESWill this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?BERTRAMGo with me to my chamber, and advise me.I'll send her straight away: to-morrowI'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.PAROLLESWhy, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:A young man married is a man that's marr'd:Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.ExeuntSCENE IV. Paris.

O, my knave, how does my old lady?ClownSo that you had her wrinkles and I her money,I would she did as you say.PAROLLESWhy, I say nothing.ClownMarry, you are the wiser man; for many a man'stongue shakes out his master's undoing: to saynothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to havenothing, is to be a great part of your title; whichis within a very little of nothing.PAROLLESAway! thou'rt a knave.ClownYou should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt aknave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this hadbeen truth, sir.PAROLLESGo to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.ClownDid you find me in yourself, sir? or were youtaught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;and much fool may you find in you, even to theworld's pleasure and the increase of laughter.PAROLLESA good knave, i' faith, and well fed.Madam, my lord will go away to-night;A very serious business calls on him.The great prerogative and rite of love,Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,Which they distil now in the curbed time,To make the coming hour o'erflow with joyAnd pleasure drown the brim.HELENAWhat's his will else?PAROLLESThat you will take your instant leave o' the kingAnd make this haste as your own good proceeding,Strengthen'd with what apology you thinkMay make it probable need.HELENAWhat more commands he?PAROLLESThat, having this obtain'd, you presentlyAttend his further pleasure.HELENAIn every thing I wait upon his will.PAROLLESI shall report it so.HELENAI pray you.Exit PAROLLESCome, sirrah.ExeuntSCENE V.

The COUNT's palace.Enter COUNTESS and ClownCOUNTESSIt hath happened all as I would have had it, savethat he comes not along with her.ClownBy my troth, I take my young lord to be a verymelancholy man.COUNTESSBy what observance, I pray you?ClownWhy, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend theruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick histeeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick ofmelancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.COUNTESSLet me see what he writes, and when he means to come.Opening a letterClownI have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: ourold ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothinglike your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin tolove, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.COUNTESSWhat have we here?ClownE'en that you have there.ExitCOUNTESS[Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hathrecovered the king, and undone me. I have weddedher, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know itbefore the report come. If there be breadth enoughin the world, I will hold a long distance. My dutyto you. Your unfortunate son,BERTRAM.This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.To fly the favours of so good a king;To pluck his indignation on thy headBy the misprising of a maid too virtuousFor the contempt of empire.Re-enter ClownClownO madam, yonder is heavy news within between twosoldiers and my young lady!COUNTESSWhat is the matter?ClownNay, there is some comfort in the news, somecomfort; your son will not be killed so soon as Ithought he would.COUNTESSWhy should he be killed?ClownSo say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss ofmen, though it be the getting of children. Herethey come will tell you more: for my part, I onlyhear your son was run away.ExitEnter HELENA, and two GentlemenFirst GentlemanSave you, good madam.HELENAMadam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.Second GentlemanDo not say so.COUNTESSThink upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,That the first face of neither, on the start,Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?Second GentlemanMadam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:We met him thitherward; for thence we came,And, after some dispatch in hand at court,Thither we bend again.HELENALook on his letter, madam; here's my passport.ReadsWhen thou canst get the ring upon my finger whichnever shall come off, and show me a child begottenof thy body that I am father to, then call mehusband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'This is a dreadful sentence.COUNTESSBrought you this letter, gentlemen?First GentlemanAy, madam;And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.COUNTESSI prithee, lady, have a better cheer;If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;But I do wash his name out of my blood,And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?Second GentlemanAy, madam.COUNTESSAnd to be a soldier?Second GentlemanSuch is his noble purpose; and believe 't,The duke will lay upon him all the honourThat good convenience claims.COUNTESSReturn you thither?First GentlemanAy, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.HELENA[Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.'Tis bitter.COUNTESSFind you that there?HELENAAy, madam.First Gentleman'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which hisheart was not consenting to.COUNTESSNothing in France, until he have no wife!There's nothing here that is too good for himBut only she; and she deserves a lordThat twenty such rude boys might tend uponAnd call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?First GentlemanA servant only, and a gentlemanWhich I have sometime known.COUNTESSParolles, was it not?First GentlemanAy, my good lady, he.COUNTESSA very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.My son corrupts a well-derived natureWith his inducement.First GentlemanIndeed, good lady,The fellow has a deal of that too much,Which holds him much to have.COUNTESSYou're welcome, gentlemen.I will entreat you, when you see my son,To tell him that his sword can never winThe honour that he loses: more I'll entreat youWritten to bear along.Second GentlemanWe serve you, madam,In that and all your worthiest affairs.COUNTESSNot so, but as we change our courtesies.Will you draw near!Exeunt COUNTESS and GentlemenHELENA'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'Nothing in France, until he has no wife!Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't IThat chase thee from thy country and exposeThose tender limbs of thine to the eventOf the none-sparing war? and is it IThat drive thee from the sportive court, where thouWast shot at with fair eyes, to be the markOf smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,That ride upon the violent speed of fire,Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;Whoever charges on his forward breast,I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;And, though I kill him not, I am the causeHis death was so effected: better 'twereI met the ravin lion when he roar'dWith sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twereThat all the miseries which nature owesWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,As oft it loses all: I will be gone;My being here it is that holds thee hence:Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, althoughThe air of paradise did fan the houseAnd angels officed all: I will be gone,That pitiful rumour may report my flight,To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.ExitSCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and TrumpetsDUKEThe general of our horse thou art; and we,Great in our hope, lay our best love and credenceUpon thy promising fortune.BERTRAMSir, it isA charge too heavy for my strength, but yetWe'll strive to bear it for your worthy sakeTo the extreme edge of hazard.DUKEThen go thou forth;And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,As thy auspicious mistress!BERTRAMThis very day,Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall proveA lover of thy drum, hater of love.ExeuntSCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.Enter COUNTESS and StewardCOUNTESSAlas! and would you take the letter of her?Might you not know she would do as she has done,By sending me a letter? Read it again.Steward[Reads]I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:Ambitious love hath so in me offended,That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,With sainted vow my faults to have amended.Write, write, that from the bloody course of warMy dearest master, your dear son, may hie:Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from farHis name with zealous fervor sanctify:His taken labours bid him me forgive;I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forthFrom courtly friends, with camping foes to live,Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:He is too good and fair for death and me:Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.COUNTESSAh, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,I could have well diverted her intents,Which thus she hath prevented.StewardPardon me, madam:If I had given you this at over-night,She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,Pursuit would be but vain.COUNTESSWhat angel shallBless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hearAnd loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrathOf greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,To this unworthy husband of his wife;Let every word weigh heavy of her worthThat he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.Dispatch the most convenient messenger:When haply he shall hear that she is gone,He will return; and hope I may that she,Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,Led hither by pure love: which of them bothIs dearest to me. I have no skill in senseTo make distinction: provide this messenger:My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.ExeuntSCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CitizensWidowNay, come; for if they do approach the city, weshall lose all the sight.DIANAThey say the French count has done most honourable service.WidowIt is reported that he has taken their greatestcommander; and that with his own hand he slew theduke's brother.TucketWe have lost our labour; they are gone a contraryway: hark! you may know by their trumpets.MARIANACome, let's return again, and suffice ourselves withthe report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of thisFrench earl: the honour of a maid is her name; andno legacy is so rich as honesty.WidowI have told my neighbour how you have been solicitedby a gentleman his companion.MARIANAI know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: afilthy officer he is in those suggestions for theyoung earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines oflust, are not the things they go under: many a maidhath been seduced by them; and the misery is,example, that so terrible shows in the wreck ofmaidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,but that they are limed with the twigs that threatenthem. I hope I need not to advise you further; butI hope your own grace will keep you where you are,though there were no further danger known but themodesty which is so lost.DIANAYou shall not need to fear me.WidowI hope so.Enter HELENA, disguised like a PilgrimLook, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie atmy house; thither they send one another: I'llquestion her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?HELENATo Saint Jaques le Grand.Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?WidowAt the Saint Francis here beside the port.HELENAIs this the way?WidowAy, marry, is't.A march afarHark you! they come this way.If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,But till the troops come by,I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;The rather, for I think I know your hostessAs ample as myself.HELENAIs it yourself?WidowIf you shall please so, pilgrim.HELENAI thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.WidowYou came, I think, from France?HELENAI did so.WidowHere you shall see a countryman of yoursThat has done worthy service.HELENAHis name, I pray you.DIANAThe Count Rousillon: know you such a one?HELENABut by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:His face I know not.DIANAWhatsome'er he is,He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,As 'tis reported, for the king had married himAgainst his liking: think you it is so?HELENAAy, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.DIANAThere is a gentleman that serves the countReports but coarsely of her.HELENAWhat's his name?DIANAMonsieur Parolles.HELENAO, I believe with him,In argument of praise, or to the worthOf the great count himself, she is too meanTo have her name repeated: all her deservingIs a reserved honesty, and thatI have not heard examined.DIANAAlas, poor lady!'Tis a hard bondage to become the wifeOf a detesting lord.WidowI warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do herA shrewd turn, if she pleased.HELENAHow do you mean?May be the amorous count solicits herIn the unlawful purpose.WidowHe does indeed;And brokes with all that can in such a suitCorrupt the tender honour of a maid:But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guardIn honestest defence.MARIANAThe gods forbid else!WidowSo, now they come:Drum and ColoursEnter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole armyThat is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;That, Escalus.HELENAWhich is the Frenchman?DIANAHe;That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.I would he loved his wife: if he were honesterHe were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?HELENAI like him well.DIANA'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knaveThat leads him to these places: were I his lady,I would Poison that vile rascal.HELENAWhich is he?DIANAThat jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?HELENAPerchance he's hurt i' the battle.PAROLLESLose our drum! well.MARIANAHe's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.WidowMarry, hang you!MARIANAAnd your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and armyWidowThe troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring youWhere you shall host: of enjoin'd penitentsThere's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,Already at my house.HELENAI humbly thank you:Please it this matron and this gentle maidTo eat with us to-night, the charge and thankingShall be for me; and, to requite you further,I will bestow some precepts of this virginWorthy the note.BOTHWe'll take your offer kindly.ExeuntSCENE VI. Camp before Florence.Enter BERTRAM and the two French LordsSecond LordNay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have hisway.First LordIf your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me nomore in your respect.Second LordOn my life, my lord, a bubble.BERTRAMDo you think I am so far deceived in him?Second LordBelieve it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,without any malice, but to speak of him as mykinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite andendless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the ownerof no one good quality worthy your lordship'sentertainment.First LordIt were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far inhis virtue, which he hath not, he might at somegreat and trusty business in a main danger fail you.BERTRAMI would I knew in what particular action to try him.First LordNone better than to let him fetch off his drum,which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.Second LordI, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenlysurprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure heknows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwinkhim so, that he shall suppose no other but that heis carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, whenwe bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordshippresent at his examination: if he do not, for thepromise of his life and in the highest compulsion ofbase fear, offer to betray you and deliver all theintelligence in his power against you, and that withthe divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, nevertrust my judgment in any thing.First LordO, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;he says he has a stratagem for't: when yourlordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and towhat metal this counterfeit lump of ore will bemelted, if you give him not John Drum'sentertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.Here he comes.Enter PAROLLESSecond Lord[Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetchoff his drum in any hand.BERTRAMHow now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in yourdisposition.First LordA pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.PAROLLES'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!There was excellent command,--to charge in with ourhorse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!First LordThat was not to be blamed in the command of theservice: it was a disaster of war that Caesarhimself could not have prevented, if he had beenthere to command.BERTRAMWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: somedishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it isnot to be recovered.PAROLLESIt might have been recovered.BERTRAMIt might; but it is not now.PAROLLESIt is to be recovered: but that the merit ofservice is seldom attributed to the true and exactperformer, I would have that drum or another, or'hic jacet.'BERTRAMWhy, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if youthink your mystery in stratagem can bring thisinstrument of honour again into his native quarter,be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I willgrace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if youspeed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.and extend to you what further becomes hisgreatness, even to the utmost syllable of yourworthiness.PAROLLESBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.BERTRAMBut you must not now slumber in it.PAROLLESI'll about it this evening: and I will presentlypen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in mycertainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;and by midnight look to hear further from me.BERTRAMMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?PAROLLESI know not what the success will be, my lord; butthe attempt I vow.BERTRAMI know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility ofthy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.PAROLLESI love not many words.ExitSecond LordNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this astrange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seemsto undertake this business, which he knows is not tobe done; damns himself to do and dares better bedamned than to do't?First LordYou do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain itis that he will steal himself into a man's favour andfor a week escape a great deal of discoveries; butwhen you find him out, you have him ever after.BERTRAMWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all ofthis that so seriously he does address himself unto?Second LordNone in the world; but return with an invention andclap upon you two or three probable lies: but wehave almost embossed him; you shall see his fallto-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.First LordWe'll make you some sport with the fox ere we casehim. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what asprat you shall find him; which you shall see thisvery night.Second LordI must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.BERTRAMYour brother he shall go along with me.Second LordAs't please your lordship: I'll leave you.ExitBERTRAMNow will I lead you to the house, and show youThe lass I spoke of.First LordBut you say she's honest.BERTRAMThat's all the fault: I spoke with her but onceAnd found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,Tokens and letters which she did re-send;And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:Will you go see her?First LordWith all my heart, my lord.ExeuntSCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.Enter HELENA and WidowHELENAIf you misdoubt me that I am not she,I know not how I shall assure you further,But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.WidowThough my estate be fallen, I was well born,Nothing acquainted with these businesses;And would not put my reputation nowIn any staining act.HELENANor would I wish you.First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,And what to your sworn counsel I have spokenIs so from word to word; and then you cannot,By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,Err in bestowing it.WidowI should believe you:For you have show'd me that which well approvesYou're great in fortune.HELENATake this purse of gold,And let me buy your friendly help thus far,Which I will over-pay and pay againWhen I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.Now his important blood will nought denyThat she'll demand: a ring the county wears,That downward hath succeeded in his houseFrom son to son, some four or five descentsSince the first father wore it: this ring he holdsIn most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,Howe'er repented after.WidowNow I seeThe bottom of your purpose.HELENAYou see it lawful, then: it is no more,But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;In fine, delivers me to fill the time,Herself most chastely absent: after this,To marry her, I'll add three thousand crownsTo what is passed already.WidowI have yielded:Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,That time and place with this deceit so lawfulMay prove coherent. Every night he comesWith musics of all sorts and songs composedTo her unworthiness: it nothing steads usTo chide him from our eaves; for he persistsAs if his life lay on't.HELENAWhy then to-nightLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,Is wicked meaning in a lawful deedAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:But let's about it.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambushSecond LordHe can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.When you sally upon him, speak what terriblelanguage you will: though you understand it notyourselves, no matter; for we must not seem tounderstand him, unless some one among us whom wemust produce for an interpreter.First SoldierGood captain, let me be the interpreter.Second LordArt not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?First SoldierNo, sir, I warrant you.Second LordBut what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?First SoldierE'en such as you speak to me.Second LordHe must think us some band of strangers i' theadversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack ofall neighbouring languages; therefore we must everyone be a man of his own fancy, not to know what wespeak one to another; so we seem to know, is toknow straight our purpose: choughs' language,gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,and then to return and swear the lies he forges.Enter PAROLLESPAROLLESTen o'clock: within these three hours 'twill betime enough to go home. What shall I say I havedone? It must be a very plausive invention thatcarries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraceshave of late knocked too often at my door. I findmy tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath thefear of Mars before it and of his creatures, notdaring the reports of my tongue.Second LordThis is the first truth that e'er thine own tonguewas guilty of.PAROLLESWhat the devil should move me to undertake therecovery of this drum, being not ignorant of theimpossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? Imust give myself some hurts, and say I got them inexploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; theywill say, 'Came you off with so little?' and greatones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's theinstance? Tongue, I must put you into abutter-woman's mouth and buy myself another ofBajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.Second LordIs it possible he should know what he is, and bethat he is?PAROLLESI would the cutting of my garments would serve theturn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.Second LordWe cannot afford you so.PAROLLESOr the baring of my beard; and to say it was instratagem.Second Lord'Twould not do.PAROLLESOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.Second LordHardly serve.PAROLLESThough I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.Second LordHow deep?PAROLLESThirty fathom.Second LordThree great oaths would scarce make that be believed.PAROLLESI would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swearI recovered it.Second LordYou shall hear one anon.PAROLLESA drum now of the enemy's,--Alarum withinSecond LordThroca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.AllCargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.PAROLLESO, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.They seize and blindfold himFirst SoldierBoskos thromuldo boskos.PAROLLESI know you are the Muskos' regiment:And I shall lose my life for want of language;If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'llDiscover that which shall undo the Florentine.First SoldierBoskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speakthy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thyfaith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.PAROLLESO!First SoldierO, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.Second LordOscorbidulchos volivorco.First SoldierThe general is content to spare thee yet;And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee onTo gather from thee: haply thou mayst informSomething to save thy life.PAROLLESO, let me live!And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak thatWhich you will wonder at.First SoldierBut wilt thou faithfully?PAROLLESIf I do not, damn me.First SoldierAcordo linta.Come on; thou art granted space.Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum withinSecond LordGo, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffledTill we do hear from them.Second SoldierCaptain, I will.Second LordA' will betray us all unto ourselves:Inform on that.Second SoldierSo I will, sir.Second LordTill then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.ExeuntSCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.Enter BERTRAM and DIANABERTRAMThey told me that your name was Fontibell.DIANANo, my good lord, Diana.BERTRAMTitled goddess;And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,In your fine frame hath love no quality?If quick fire of youth light not your mind,You are no maiden, but a monument:When you are dead, you should be such a oneAs you are now, for you are cold and stem;And now you should be as your mother wasWhen your sweet self was got.DIANAShe then was honest.BERTRAMSo should you be.DIANANo:My mother did but duty; such, my lord,As you owe to your wife.BERTRAMNo more o' that;I prithee, do not strive against my vows:I was compell'd to her; but I love theeBy love's own sweet constraint, and will for everDo thee all rights of service.DIANAAy, so you serve usTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselvesAnd mock us with our bareness.BERTRAMHow have I sworn!DIANA'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.What is not holy, that we swear not by,But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,If I should swear by God's great attributes,I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,When I did love you ill? This has no holding,To swear by him whom I protest to love,That I will work against him: therefore your oathsAre words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,At least in my opinion.BERTRAMChange it, change it;Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;And my integrity ne'er knew the craftsThat you do charge men with. Stand no more off,But give thyself unto my sick desires,Who then recover: say thou art mine, and everMy love as it begins shall so persever.DIANAI see that men make ropes in such a scarreThat we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.BERTRAMI'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no powerTo give it from me.DIANAWill you not, my lord?BERTRAMIt is an honour 'longing to our house,Bequeathed down from many ancestors;Which were the greatest obloquy i' the worldIn me to lose.DIANAMine honour's such a ring:My chastity's the jewel of our house,Bequeathed down from many ancestors;Which were the greatest obloquy i' the worldIn me to lose: thus your own proper wisdomBrings in the champion Honour on my part,Against your vain assault.BERTRAMHere, take my ring:My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,And I'll be bid by thee.DIANAWhen midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:I'll order take my mother shall not hear.Now will I charge you in the band of truth,When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:My reasons are most strong; and you shall know themWhen back again this ring shall be deliver'd:And on your finger in the night I'll putAnother ring, that what in time proceedsMay token to the future our past deeds.Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have wonA wife of me, though there my hope be done.BERTRAMA heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.ExitDIANAFor which live long to thank both heaven and me!You may so in the end.My mother told me just how he would woo,As if she sat in 's heart; she says all menHave the like oaths: he had sworn to marry meWhen his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with himWhen I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,Marry that will, I live and die a maid:Only in this disguise I think't no sinTo cozen him that would unjustly win.ExitSCENE III. The Florentine camp.Enter the two French Lords and some two or three SoldiersFirst LordYou have not given him his mother's letter?Second LordI have delivered it an hour since: there issomething in't that stings his nature; for on thereading it he changed almost into another man.First LordHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shakingoff so good a wife and so sweet a lady.Second LordEspecially he hath incurred the everlastingdispleasure of the king, who had even tuned hisbounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you athing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.First LordWhen you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am thegrave of it.Second LordHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here inFlorence, of a most chaste renown; and this night hefleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hathgiven her his monumental ring, and thinks himselfmade in the unchaste composition.First LordNow, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,what things are we!Second LordMerely our own traitors. And as in the common courseof all treasons, we still see them revealthemselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,so he that in this action contrives against his ownnobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.First LordIs it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters ofour unlawful intents? We shall not then have hiscompany to-night?Second LordNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.First LordThat approaches apace; I would gladly have him seehis company anatomized, that he might take a measureof his own judgments, wherein so curiously he hadset this counterfeit.Second LordWe will not meddle with him till he come; for hispresence must be the whip of the other.First LordIn the mean time, what hear you of these wars?Second LordI hear there is an overture of peace.First LordNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.Second LordWhat will Count Rousillon do then? will he travelhigher, or return again into France?First LordI perceive, by this demand, you are not altogetherof his council.Second LordLet it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great dealof his act.First LordSir, his wife some two months since fled from hishouse: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaquesle Grand; which holy undertaking with most austeresanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing thetenderness of her nature became as a prey to hergrief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, andnow she sings in heaven.Second LordHow is this justified?First LordThe stronger part of it by her own letters, whichmakes her story true, even to the point of herdeath: her death itself, which could not be heroffice to say is come, was faithfully confirmed bythe rector of the place.Second LordHath the count all this intelligence?First LordAy, and the particular confirmations, point frompoint, so to the full arming of the verity.Second LordI am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.First LordHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!Second LordAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gainin tears! The great dignity that his valour hathhere acquired for him shall at home be encounteredwith a shame as ample.First LordThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good andill together: our virtues would be proud, if ourfaults whipped them not; and our crimes woulddespair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.Enter a MessengerHow now! where's your master?ServantHe met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hathtaken a solemn leave: his lordship will nextmorning for France. The duke hath offered himletters of commendations to the king.Second LordThey shall be no more than needful there, if theywere more than they can commend.First LordThey cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.Here's his lordship now.Enter BERTRAMHow now, my lord! is't not after midnight?BERTRAMI have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, amonth's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with hisnearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to mylady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;and between these main parcels of dispatch effectedmany nicer needs; the last was the greatest, butthat I have not ended yet.Second LordIf the business be of any difficulty, and thismorning your departure hence, it requires haste ofyour lordship.BERTRAMI mean, the business is not ended, as fearing tohear of it hereafter. But shall we have thisdialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceivedme, like a double-meaning prophesier.Second LordBring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,poor gallant knave.BERTRAMNo matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurpinghis spurs so long. How does he carry himself?Second LordI have told your lordship already, the stocks carryhim. But to answer you as you would be understood;he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: hehath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposesto be a friar, from the time of his remembrance tothis very instant disaster of his setting i' thestocks: and what think you he hath confessed?BERTRAMNothing of me, has a'?Second LordHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to hisface: if your lordship be in't, as I believe youare, you must have the patience to hear it.Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First SoldierBERTRAMA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing ofme: hush, hush!First LordHoodman comes! PortotartarosaFirst SoldierHe calls for the tortures: what will you saywithout 'em?PAROLLESI will confess what I know without constraint: ifye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.First SoldierBosko chimurcho.First LordBoblibindo chicurmurco.First SoldierYou are a merciful general. Our general bids youanswer to what I shall ask you out of a note.PAROLLESAnd truly, as I hope to live.First Soldier[Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse theduke is strong.' What say you to that?PAROLLESFive or six thousand; but very weak andunserviceable: the troops are all scattered, andthe commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputationand credit and as I hope to live.First SoldierShall I set down your answer so?PAROLLESDo: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.BERTRAMAll's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!First LordYou're deceived, my lord: this is MonsieurParolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his ownphrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in theknot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape ofhis dagger.Second LordI will never trust a man again for keeping his swordclean. nor believe he can have every thing in himby wearing his apparel neatly.First SoldierWell, that's set down.PAROLLESFive or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will saytrue,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.First LordHe's very near the truth in this.BERTRAMBut I con him no thanks for't, in the nature hedelivers it.PAROLLESPoor rogues, I pray you, say.First SoldierWell, that's set down.PAROLLESI humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, therogues are marvellous poor.First Soldier[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they area-foot.' What say you to that?PAROLLESBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this presenthour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, ahundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, somany; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine owncompany, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred andfifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten andsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousandpoll; half of the which dare not shake snow from offtheir cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.BERTRAMWhat shall be done to him?First LordNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him mycondition, and what credit I have with the duke.First SoldierWell, that's set down.Reads'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumainbe i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation iswith the duke; what his valour, honesty, andexpertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were notpossible, with well-weighing sums of gold, tocorrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? whatdo you know of it?PAROLLESI beseech you, let me answer to the particular ofthe inter'gatories: demand them singly.First SoldierDo you know this Captain Dumain?PAROLLESI know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve'sfool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could notsay him nay.BERTRAMNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I knowhis brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.First SoldierWell, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?PAROLLESUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.First LordNay look not so upon me; we shall hear of yourlordship anon.First SoldierWhat is his reputation with the duke?PAROLLESThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officerof mine; and writ to me this other day to turn himout o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.First SoldierMarry, we'll search.PAROLLESIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,or it is upon a file with the duke's other lettersin my tent.First SoldierHere 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?PAROLLESI do not know if it be it or no.BERTRAMOur interpreter does it well.First LordExcellently.First Soldier[Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--PAROLLESThat is not the duke's letter, sir; that is anadvertisement to a proper maid in Florence, oneDiana, to take heed of the allurement of one CountRousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that veryruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.First SoldierNay, I'll read it first, by your favour.PAROLLESMy meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in thebehalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to bea dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale tovirginity and devours up all the fry it finds.BERTRAMDamnable both-sides rogue!First Soldier[Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;After he scores, he never pays the score:Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,PAROLLES.'BERTRAMHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhymein's forehead.Second LordThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifoldlinguist and the armipotent soldier.BERTRAMI could endure any thing before but a cat, and nowhe's a cat to me.First SoldierI perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall befain to hang you.PAROLLESMy life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid todie; but that, my offences being many, I wouldrepent out the remainder of nature: let me live,sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.First SoldierWe'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: youhave answered to his reputation with the duke and tohis valour: what is his honesty?PAROLLESHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: forrapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: heprofesses not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em heis stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, withsuch volubility, that you would think truth were afool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he willbe swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does littleharm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but theyknow his conditions and lay him in straw. I have butlittle more to say, sir, of his honesty: he hasevery thing that an honest man should not have; whatan honest man should have, he has nothing.First LordI begin to love him for this.BERTRAMFor this description of thine honesty? A pox uponhim for me, he's more and more a cat.First SoldierWhat say you to his expertness in war?PAROLLESFaith, sir, he has led the drum before the Englishtragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more ofhis soldiership I know not; except, in that countryhe had the honour to be the officer at a place therecalled Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling offiles: I would do the man what honour I can, but ofthis I am not certain.First LordHe hath out-villained villany so far, that therarity redeems him.BERTRAMA pox on him, he's a cat still.First SoldierHis qualities being at this poor price, I need notto ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.PAROLLESSir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simpleof his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut theentail from all remainders, and a perpetualsuccession for it perpetually.First SoldierWhat's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?Second LordWhy does be ask him of me?First SoldierWhat's he?PAROLLESE'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether sogreat as the first in goodness, but greater a greatdeal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in comingon he has the cramp.First SoldierIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betraythe Florentine?PAROLLESAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.First SoldierI'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.PAROLLES[Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of alldrums! Only to seem to deserve well, and tobeguile the supposition of that lascivious young boythe count, have I run into this danger. Yet whowould have suspected an ambush where I was taken?First SoldierThere is no remedy, sir, but you must die: thegeneral says, you that have so traitorouslydiscovered the secrets of your army and made suchpestiferous reports of men very nobly held, canserve the world for no honest use; therefore youmust die. Come, headsman, off with his head.PAROLLESO Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!First LordThat shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.Unblinding himSo, look about you: know you any here?BERTRAMGood morrow, noble captain.Second LordGod bless you, Captain Parolles.First LordGod save you, noble captain.Second LordCaptain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?I am for France.First LordGood captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnetyou writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:but fare you well.Exeunt BERTRAM and LordsFirst SoldierYou are undone, captain, all but your scarf; thathas a knot on't yetPAROLLESWho cannot be crushed with a plot?First SoldierIf you could find out a country where but women werethat had received so much shame, you might begin animpudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for Francetoo: we shall speak of you there.Exit with SoldiersPAROLLESYet am I thankful: if my heart were great,'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;But I will eat and drink, and sleep as softAs captain shall: simply the thing I amShall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,Let him fear this, for it will come to passthat every braggart shall be found an ass.Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, liveSafest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!There's place and means for every man alive.I'll after them.ExitSCENE IV.

The Widow's house.Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANAHELENAThat you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,One of the greatest in the Christian worldShall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:Time was, I did him a desired office,Dear almost as his life; which gratitudeThrough flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'dHis grace is at Marseilles; to which placeWe have convenient convoy. You must knowI am supposed dead: the army breaking,My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,And by the leave of my good lord the king,We'll be before our welcome.WidowGentle madam,You never had a servant to whose trustYour business was more welcome.HELENANor you, mistress,Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labourTo recompense your love: doubt not but heavenHath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,As it hath fated her to be my motiveAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!That can such sweet use make of what they hate,When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughtsDefiles the pitchy night: so lust doth playWith what it loathes for that which is away.But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,Under my poor instructions yet must sufferSomething in my behalf.DIANALet death and honestyGo with your impositions, I am yoursUpon your will to suffer.HELENAYet, I pray you:But with the word the time will bring on summer,When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.ExeuntSCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and ClownLAFEUNo, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffetafellow there, whose villanous saffron would havemade all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation inhis colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive atthis hour, and your son here at home, more advancedby the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.COUNTESSI would I had not known him; it was the death of themost virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature hadpraise for creating. If she had partaken of myflesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, Icould not have owed her a more rooted love.LAFEU'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick athousand salads ere we light on such another herb.ClownIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of thesalad, or rather, the herb of grace.LAFEUThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.ClownI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not muchskill in grass.LAFEUWhether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?ClownA fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.LAFEUYour distinction?ClownI would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.LAFEUSo you were a knave at his service, indeed.ClownAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.LAFEUI will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.ClownAt your service.LAFEUNo, no, no.ClownWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve asgreat a prince as you are.LAFEUWho's that? a Frenchman?ClownFaith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomyis more hotter in France than there.LAFEUWhat prince is that?ClownThe black prince, sir; alias, the prince ofdarkness; alias, the devil.LAFEUHold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not thisto suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;serve him still.ClownI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved agreat fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps agood fire. But, sure, he is the prince of theworld; let his nobility remain in's court. I am forthe house with the narrow gate, which I take to betoo little for pomp to enter: some that humblethemselves may; but the many will be too chill andtender, and they'll be for the flowery way thatleads to the broad gate and the great fire.LAFEUGo thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and Itell thee so before, because I would not fall outwith thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be welllooked to, without any tricks.ClownIf I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall bejades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.ExitLAFEUA shrewd knave and an unhappy.COUNTESSSo he is. My lord that's gone made himself muchsport out of him: by his authority he remains here,which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.LAFEUI like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about totell you, since I heard of the good lady's death andthat my lord your son was upon his return home, Imoved the king my master to speak in the behalf ofmy daughter; which, in the minority of them both,his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, didfirst propose: his highness hath promised me to doit: and, to stop up the displeasure he hathconceived against your son, there is no fittermatter. How does your ladyship like it?COUNTESSWith very much content, my lord; and I wish ithappily effected.LAFEUHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as ablebody as when he numbered thirty: he will be hereto-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in suchintelligence hath seldom failed.COUNTESSIt rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere Idie. I have letters that my son will be hereto-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remainwith me till they meet together.LAFEUMadam, I was thinking with what manners I mightsafely be admitted.COUNTESSYou need but plead your honourable privilege.LAFEULady, of that I have made a bold charter; but Ithank my God it holds yet.Re-enter ClownClownO madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch ofvelvet on's face: whether there be a scar under'tor no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch ofvelvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and ahalf, but his right cheek is worn bare.LAFEUA scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liveryof honour; so belike is that.ClownBut it is your carbonadoed face.LAFEULet us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talkwith the young noble soldier.ClownFaith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate finehats and most courteous feathers, which bow the headand nod at every man.ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

Prithee, getthee further.PAROLLESPray you, sir, deliver me this paper.ClownFoh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune'sclose-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here hecomes himself.Enter LAFEUHere is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune'scat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into theunclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as hesays, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use thecarp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity hisdistress in my similes of comfort and leave him toyour lordship.ExitPAROLLESMy lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruellyscratched.LAFEUAnd what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late topare her nails now. Wherein have you played theknave with fortune, that she should scratch you, whoof herself is a good lady and would not have knavesthrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu foryou: let the justices make you and fortune friends:I am for other business.PAROLLESI beseech your honour to hear me one single word.LAFEUYou beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;save your word.PAROLLESMy name, my good lord, is Parolles.LAFEUYou beg more than 'word,' then.

The COUNT's palace.Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with AttendantsKINGWe lost a jewel of her; and our esteemWas made much poorer by it: but your son,As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to knowHer estimation home.COUNTESS'Tis past, my liege;And I beseech your majesty to make itNatural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,O'erbears it and burns on.KINGMy honour'd lady,I have forgiven and forgotten all;Though my revenges were high bent upon him,And watch'd the time to shoot.LAFEUThis I must say,But first I beg my pardon, the young lordDid to his majesty, his mother and his ladyOffence of mighty note; but to himselfThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wifeWhose beauty did astonish the surveyOf richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serveHumbly call'd mistress.KINGPraising what is lostMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;We are reconciled, and the first view shall killAll repetition: let him not ask our pardon;The nature of his great offence is dead,And deeper than oblivion we do buryThe incensing relics of it: let him approach,A stranger, no offender; and inform himSo 'tis our will he should.GentlemanI shall, my liege.ExitKINGWhat says he to your daughter? have you spoke?LAFEUAll that he is hath reference to your highness.KINGThen shall we have a match. I have letters sent meThat set him high in fame.Enter BERTRAMLAFEUHe looks well on't.KINGI am not a day of season,For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hailIn me at once: but to the brightest beamsDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;The time is fair again.BERTRAMMy high-repented blames,Dear sovereign, pardon to me.KINGAll is whole;Not one word more of the consumed time.Let's take the instant by the forward top;For we are old, and on our quick'st decreesThe inaudible and noiseless foot of TimeSteals ere we can effect them. You rememberThe daughter of this lord?BERTRAMAdmiringly, my liege, at firstI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heartDurst make too bold a herald of my tongueWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,Which warp'd the line of every other favour;Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;Extended or contracted all proportionsTo a most hideous object: thence it cameThat she whom all men praised and whom myself,Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eyeThe dust that did offend it.KINGWell excused:That thou didst love her, strikes some scores awayFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,To the great sender turns a sour offence,Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faultsMake trivial price of serious things we have,Not knowing them until we know their grave:Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,Destroy our friends and after weep their dustOur own love waking cries to see what's done,While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:The main consents are had; and here we'll stayTo see our widower's second marriage-day.COUNTESSWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!LAFEUCome on, my son, in whom my house's nameMust be digested, give a favour from youTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,That she may quickly come.BERTRAM gives a ringBy my old beard,And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,The last that e'er I took her at court,I saw upon her finger.BERTRAMHers it was not.KINGNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,I bade her, if her fortunes ever stoodNecessitied to help, that by this tokenI would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reaveherOf what should stead her most?BERTRAMMy gracious sovereign,Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,The ring was never hers.COUNTESSSon, on my life,I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd itAt her life's rate.LAFEUI am sure I saw her wear it.BERTRAMYou are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the nameOf her that threw it: noble she was, and thoughtI stood engaged: but when I had subscribedTo mine own fortune and inform'd her fullyI could not answer in that course of honourAs she had made the overture, she ceasedIn heavy satisfaction and would neverReceive the ring again.KINGPlutus himself,That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,Hath not in nature's mystery more scienceThan I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,Whoever gave it you. Then, if you knowThat you are well acquainted with yourself,Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcementYou got it from her: she call'd the saints to suretyThat she would never put it from her finger,Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,Where you have never come, or sent it usUpon her great disaster.BERTRAMShe never saw it.KINGThou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;And makest conjectural fears to come into meWhich I would fain shut out. If it should proveThat thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,And she is dead; which nothing, but to closeHer eyes myself, could win me to believe,More than to see this ring. Take him away.Guards seize BERTRAMMy fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,Shall tax my fears of little vanity,Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!We'll sift this matter further.BERTRAMIf you shall proveThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easyProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,Where yet she never was.Exit, guardedKINGI am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.Enter a GentlemanGentlemanGracious sovereign,Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:Here's a petition from a Florentine,Who hath for four or five removes come shortTo tender it herself. I undertook it,Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speechOf the poor suppliant, who by this I knowIs here attending: her business looks in herWith an importing visage; and she told me,In a sweet verbal brief, it did concernYour highness with herself.KING[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry mewhen his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he wonme. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vowsare forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. Hestole from Florence, taking no leave, and I followhim to his country for justice: grant it me, Oking! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducerflourishes, and a poor maid is undone.DIANA CAPILET.LAFEUI will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll forthis: I'll none of him.KINGThe heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,To bring forth this discovery.

O, behold this ring,Whose high respect and rich validityDid lack a parallel; yet for all thatHe gave it to a commoner o' the camp,If I be one.COUNTESSHe blushes, and 'tis it:Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;That ring's a thousand proofs.KINGMethought you saidYou saw one here in court could witness it.DIANAI did, my lord, but loath am to produceSo bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.LAFEUI saw the man to-day, if man he be.KINGFind him, and bring him hither.Exit an AttendantBERTRAMWhat of him?He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,That will speak any thing?KINGShe hath that ring of yours.BERTRAMI think she has: certain it is I liked her,And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:She knew her distance and did angle for me,Madding my eagerness with her restraint,As all impediments in fancy's courseAre motives of more fancy; and, in fine,Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;And I had that which any inferior mightAt market-price have bought.DIANAI must be patient:You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,May justly diet me. I pray you yet;Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;Send for your ring, I will return it home,And give me mine again.BERTRAMI have it not.KINGWhat ring was yours, I pray you?DIANASir, much likeThe same upon your finger.KINGKnow you this ring? this ring was his of late.DIANAAnd this was it I gave him, being abed.KINGThe story then goes false, you threw it himOut of a casement.DIANAI have spoke the truth.Enter PAROLLESBERTRAMMy lord, I do confess the ring was hers.KINGYou boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.Is this the man you speak of?DIANAAy, my lord.KINGTell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,Not fearing the displeasure of your master,Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,By him and by this woman here what know you?PAROLLESSo please your majesty, my master hath been anhonourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,which gentlemen have.KINGCome, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?PAROLLESFaith, sir, he did love her; but how?KINGHow, I pray you?PAROLLESHe did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.KINGHow is that?PAROLLESHe loved her, sir, and loved her not.KINGAs thou art a knave, and no knave. What anequivocal companion is this!PAROLLESI am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.LAFEUHe's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.DIANADo you know he promised me marriage?PAROLLESFaith, I know more than I'll speak.KINGBut wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?PAROLLESYes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,as I said; but more than that, he loved her: forindeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan andof Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet Iwas in that credit with them at that time that Iknew of their going to bed, and of other motions,as promising her marriage, and things which wouldderive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will notspeak what I know.KINGThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst saythey are married: but thou art too fine in thyevidence; therefore stand aside.This ring, you say, was yours?DIANAAy, my good lord.KINGWhere did you buy it? or who gave it you?DIANAIt was not given me, nor I did not buy it.KINGWho lent it you?DIANAIt was not lent me neither.KINGWhere did you find it, then?DIANAI found it not.KINGIf it were yours by none of all these ways,How could you give it him?DIANAI never gave it him.LAFEUThis woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes offand on at pleasure.KINGThis ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.DIANAIt might be yours or hers, for aught I know.KINGTake her away; I do not like her now;To prison with her: and away with him.Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,Thou diest within this hour.DIANAI'll never tell you.KINGTake her away.DIANAI'll put in bail, my liege.KINGI think thee now some common customer.DIANABy Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.KINGWherefore hast thou accused him all this while?DIANABecause he's guilty, and he is not guilty:He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.KINGShe does abuse our ears: to prison with her.DIANAGood mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:Exit WidowThe jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,And he shall surety me. But for this lord,Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;And at that time he got his wife with child:Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:And now behold the meaning.Re-enter Widow, with HELENAKINGIs there no exorcistBeguiles the truer office of mine eyes?Is't real that I see?HELENANo, my good lord;'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,The name and not the thing.BERTRAMBoth, both. O, pardon!HELENAO my good lord, when I was like this maid,I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:'When from my finger you can get this ringAnd are by me with child,' & c. This is done:Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?BERTRAMIf she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.HELENAIf it appear not plain and prove untrue,Deadly divorce step between me and you!O my dear mother, do I see you living?LAFEUMine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:To PAROLLESGood Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.KINGLet us from point to point this story know,To make the even truth in pleasure flow.To DIANAIf thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;For I can guess that by thy honest aidThou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.Of that and all the progress, more or less,Resolvedly more leisure shall express:All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.FlourishEPILOGUEKINGThe king's a beggar, now the play is done:All is well ended, if this suit be won,That you express content; which we will pay,With strife to please you, day exceeding day:Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.ExeuntACT ISCENE I. Venice. A street.Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIOANTONIOIn sooth, I know not why I am so sad:It wearies me; you say it wearies you;But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,I am to learn;And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,That I have much ado to know myself.SALARINOYour mind is tossing on the ocean;There, where your argosies with portly sail,Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,Do overpeer the petty traffickers,That curtsy to them, do them reverence,As they fly by them with their woven wings.SALANIOBelieve me, sir, had I such venture forth,The better part of my affections wouldBe with my hopes abroad. I should be stillPlucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;And every object that might make me fearMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubtWould make me sad.SALARINOMy wind cooling my brothWould blow me to an ague, when I thoughtWhat harm a wind too great at sea might do.I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,But I should think of shallows and of flats,And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,Vailing her high-top lower than her ribsTo kiss her burial. Should I go to churchAnd see the holy edifice of stone,And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,Would scatter all her spices on the stream,Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,And, in a word, but even now worth this,And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thoughtTo think on this, and shall I lack the thoughtThat such a thing bechanced would make me sad?But tell not me; I know, AntonioIs sad to think upon his merchandise.ANTONIOBelieve me, no: I thank my fortune for it,My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,Nor to one place; nor is my whole estateUpon the fortune of this present year:Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.SALARINOWhy, then you are in love.ANTONIOFie, fie!SALARINONot in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easyFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:Some that will evermore peep through their eyesAnd laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,And other of such vinegar aspectThat they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANOSALANIOHere comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:We leave you now with better company.SALARINOI would have stay'd till I had made you merry,If worthier friends had not prevented me.ANTONIOYour worth is very dear in my regard.I take it, your own business calls on youAnd you embrace the occasion to depart.SALARINOGood morrow, my good lords.BASSANIOGood signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?SALARINOWe'll make our leisures to attend on yours.Exeunt Salarino and SalanioLORENZOMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.BASSANIOI will not fail you.GRATIANOYou look not well, Signior Antonio;You have too much respect upon the world:They lose it that do buy it with much care:Believe me, you are marvellously changed.ANTONIOI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;A stage where every man must play a part,And mine a sad one.GRATIANOLet me play the fool:With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,And let my liver rather heat with wineThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundiceBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--There are a sort of men whose visagesDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,And do a wilful stillness entertain,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinionOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'O my Antonio, I do know of theseThat therefore only are reputed wiseFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.I'll tell thee more of this another time:But fish not, with this melancholy bait,For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:I'll end my exhortation after dinner.LORENZOWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time:I must be one of these same dumb wise men,For Gratiano never lets me speak.GRATIANOWell, keep me company but two years moe,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.ANTONIOFarewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.GRATIANOThanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendableIn a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZOANTONIOIs that any thing now?BASSANIOGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, morethan any man in all Venice. His reasons are as twograins of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: youshall seek all day ere you find them, and when youhave them, they are not worth the search.ANTONIOWell, tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,That you to-day promised to tell me of?BASSANIO'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,How much I have disabled mine estate,By something showing a more swelling portThan my faint means would grant continuance:Nor do I now make moan to be abridgedFrom such a noble rate; but my chief careIs to come fairly off from the great debtsWherein my time something too prodigalHath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,I owe the most, in money and in love,And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposesHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.ANTONIOI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;And if it stand, as you yourself still do,Within the eye of honour, be assured,My purse, my person, my extremest means,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.BASSANIOIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,I shot his fellow of the self-same flightThe self-same way with more advised watch,To find the other forth, and by adventuring bothI oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,Because what follows is pure innocence.I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,That which I owe is lost; but if you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,As I will watch the aim, or to find bothOr bring your latter hazard back againAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.ANTONIOYou know me well, and herein spend but timeTo wind about my love with circumstance;And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermostThan if you had made waste of all I have:Then do but say to me what I should doThat in your knowledge may by me be done,And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.BASSANIOIn Belmont is a lady richly left;And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messages:Her name is Portia, nothing undervaluedTo Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,For the four winds blow in from every coastRenowned suitors, and her sunny locksHang on her temples like a golden fleece;Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,And many Jasons come in quest of her.O my Antonio, had I but the meansTo hold a rival place with one of them,I have a mind presages me such thrift,That I should questionless be fortunate!ANTONIOThou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;Neither have I money nor commodityTo raise a present sum: therefore go forth;Try what my credit can in Venice do:That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.Go, presently inquire, and so will I,Where money is, and I no question makeTo have it of my trust or for my sake.ExeuntSCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.Enter PORTIA and NERISSAPORTIABy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary ofthis great world.NERISSAYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were inthe same abundance as your good fortunes are: andyet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeitwith too much as they that starve with nothing. Itis no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in themean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, butcompetency lives longer.PORTIAGood sentences and well pronounced.NERISSAThey would be better, if well followed.PORTIAIf to do were as easy as to know what were good todo, chapels had been churches and poor men'scottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine thatfollows his own instructions: I can easier teachtwenty what were good to be done, than be one of thetwenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain maydevise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leapso'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness theyouth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel thecripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion tochoose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I mayneither choose whom I would nor refuse whom Idislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbedby the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?NERISSAYour father was ever virtuous; and holy men at theirdeath have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaningchooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by anyrightly but one who shall rightly love. But whatwarmth is there in your affection towards any ofthese princely suitors that are already come?PORTIAI pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namestthem, I will describe them; and, according to mydescription, level at my affection.NERISSAFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.PORTIAAy, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing buttalk of his horse; and he makes it a greatappropriation to his own good parts, that he canshoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady hismother played false with a smith.NERISSAThen there is the County Palatine.PORTIAHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If youwill not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales andsmiles not: I fear he will prove the weepingphilosopher when he grows old, being so full ofunmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather bemarried to a death's-head with a bone in his mouththan to either of these. God defend me from thesetwo!NERISSAHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?PORTIAGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,he! why, he hath a horse better than theNeapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning thanthe Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if athrostle sing, he falls straight a capering: he willfence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, Ishould marry twenty husbands. If he would despise meI would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, Ishall never requite him.NERISSAWhat say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baronof England?PORTIAYou know I say nothing to him, for he understandsnot me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,nor Italian, and you will come into the court andswear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who canconverse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his roundhose in France, his bonnet in Germany and hisbehavior every where.NERISSAWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?PORTIAThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for heborrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman andswore he would pay him again when he was able: Ithink the Frenchman became his surety and sealedunder for another.NERISSAHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?PORTIAVery vilely in the morning, when he is sober, andmost vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: whenhe is best, he is a little worse than a man, andwhen he is worst, he is little better than a beast:and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shallmake shift to go without him.NERISSAIf he should offer to choose, and choose the rightcasket, you should refuse to perform your father'swill, if you should refuse to accept him.PORTIATherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set adeep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,for if the devil be within and that temptationwithout, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.NERISSAYou need not fear, lady, the having any of theselords: they have acquainted me with theirdeterminations; which is, indeed, to return to theirhome and to trouble you with no more suit, unlessyou may be won by some other sort than your father'simposition depending on the caskets.PORTIAIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die aschaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the mannerof my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooersare so reasonable, for there is not one among thembut I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grantthem a fair departure.NERISSADo you not remember, lady, in your father's time, aVenetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hitherin company of the Marquis of Montferrat?PORTIAYes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.NERISSATrue, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolisheyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.PORTIAI remember him well, and I remember him worthy ofthy praise.Enter a Serving-manHow now! what news?ServantThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to taketheir leave: and there is a forerunner come from afifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word theprince his master will be here to-night.PORTIAIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good aheart as I can bid the other four farewell, I shouldbe glad of his approach: if he have the conditionof a saint and the complexion of a devil, I hadrather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.Whiles we shut the gatesupon one wooer, another knocks at the door.ExeuntSCENE III. Venice.

Yet his means are in supposition: hehath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to theIndies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, hehath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, andother ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But shipsare but boards, sailors but men: there be land-ratsand water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, Imean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I maytake his bond.BASSANIOBe assured you may.SHYLOCKI will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?BASSANIOIf it please you to dine with us.SHYLOCKYes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation whichyour prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. Iwill buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,walk with you, and so following, but I will not eatwith you, drink with you, nor pray with you. Whatnews on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?Enter ANTONIOBASSANIOThis is Signior Antonio.SHYLOCK[Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!I hate him for he is a Christian,But more for that in low simplicityHe lends out money gratis and brings downThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.If I can catch him once upon the hip,I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,Even there where merchants most do congregate,On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,If I forgive him!BASSANIOShylock, do you hear?SHYLOCKI am debating of my present store,And, by the near guess of my memory,I cannot instantly raise up the grossOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,Will furnish me. But soft! how many monthsDo you desire?To ANTONIORest you fair, good signior;Your worship was the last man in our mouths.ANTONIOShylock, although I neither lend nor borrowBy taking nor by giving of excess,Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'dHow much ye would?SHYLOCKAy, ay, three thousand ducats.ANTONIOAnd for three months.SHYLOCKI had forgot; three months; you told me so.Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;Methought you said you neither lend nor borrowUpon advantage.ANTONIOI do never use it.SHYLOCKWhen Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--This Jacob from our holy Abram was,As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,The third possessor; ay, he was the third--ANTONIOAnd what of him? did he take interest?SHYLOCKNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.When Laban and himself were compromisedThat all the eanlings which were streak'd and piedShould fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,In the end of autumn turned to the rams,And, when the work of generation wasBetween these woolly breeders in the act,The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,And, in the doing of the deed of kind,He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,Who then conceiving did in eaning timeFall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.ANTONIOThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;A thing not in his power to bring to pass,But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.Was this inserted to make interest good?Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?SHYLOCKI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:But note me, signior.ANTONIOMark you this, Bassanio,The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.An evil soul producing holy witnessIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,A goodly apple rotten at the heart:O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!SHYLOCKThree thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--ANTONIOWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?SHYLOCKSignior Antonio, many a time and oftIn the Rialto you have rated meAbout my moneys and my usances:Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,And all for use of that which is mine own.Well then, it now appears you need my help:Go to, then; you come to me, and you say'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;You, that did void your rheum upon my beardAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger curOver your threshold: moneys is your suitWhat should I say to you? Should I not say'Hath a dog money? is it possibleA cur can lend three thousand ducats?' OrShall I bend low and in a bondman's key,With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;You spurn'd me such a day; another timeYou call'd me dog; and for these courtesiesI'll lend you thus much moneys'?ANTONIOI am as like to call thee so again,To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.If thou wilt lend this money, lend it notAs to thy friends; for when did friendship takeA breed for barren metal of his friend?But lend it rather to thine enemy,Who, if he break, thou mayst with better faceExact the penalty.SHYLOCKWhy, look you, how you storm!I would be friends with you and have your love,Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,Supply your present wants and take no doitOf usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:This is kind I offer.BASSANIOThis were kindness.SHYLOCKThis kindness will I show.Go with me to a notary, seal me thereYour single bond; and, in a merry sport,If you repay me not on such a day,In such a place, such sum or sums as areExpress'd in the condition, let the forfeitBe nominated for an equal poundOf your fair flesh, to be cut off and takenIn what part of your body pleaseth me.ANTONIOContent, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bondAnd say there is much kindness in the Jew.BASSANIOYou shall not seal to such a bond for me:I'll rather dwell in my necessity.ANTONIOWhy, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:Within these two months, that's a month beforeThis bond expires, I do expect returnOf thrice three times the value of this bond.SHYLOCKO father Abram, what these Christians are,Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspectThe thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;If he should break his day, what should I gainBy the exaction of the forfeiture?A pound of man's flesh taken from a manIs not so estimable, profitable neither,As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attendingMOROCCOMislike me not for my complexion,The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.Bring me the fairest creature northward born,Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,And let us make incision for your love,To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mineHath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swearThe best-regarded virgins of our climeHave loved it too: I would not change this hue,Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.PORTIAIn terms of choice I am not solely ledBy nice direction of a maiden's eyes;Besides, the lottery of my destinyBars me the right of voluntary choosing:But if my father had not scanted meAnd hedged me by his wit, to yield myselfHis wife who wins me by that means I told you,Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fairAs any comer I have look'd on yetFor my affection.MOROCCOEven for that I thank you:Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the casketsTo try my fortune.

But, alas the while!If Hercules and Lichas play at diceWhich is the better man, the greater throwMay turn by fortune from the weaker hand:So is Alcides beaten by his page;And so may I, blind fortune leading me,Miss that which one unworthier may attain,And die with grieving.PORTIAYou must take your chance,And either not attempt to choose at allOr swear before you choose, if you choose wrongNever to speak to lady afterwardIn way of marriage: therefore be advised.MOROCCONor will not.

Venice. A street.Enter LAUNCELOTLAUNCELOTCertainly my conscience will serve me to run fromthis Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow andtempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, goodLauncelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good LauncelotGobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. Myconscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honestLauncelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thyheels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids mepack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says thefiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wiselyto me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honestman's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,indeed, my father did something smack, somethinggrow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my consciencesays 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says thefiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by myconscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, torun away from the Jew, I should be ruled by thefiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devilhimself. Certainly the Jew is the very devilincarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience isbut a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counselme to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the morefriendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels areat your command; I will run.Enter Old GOBBO, with a basketGOBBOMaster young man, you, I pray you, which is the wayto master Jew's?LAUNCELOT[Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,knows me not: I will try confusions with him.GOBBOMaster young gentleman, I pray you, which is the wayto master Jew's?LAUNCELOTTurn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, atthe very next turning, turn of no hand, but turndown indirectly to the Jew's house.GOBBOBy God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Canyou tell me whether one Launcelot,that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?LAUNCELOTTalk you of young Master Launcelot?AsideMark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk youof young Master Launcelot?GOBBONo master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor manand, God be thanked, well to live.LAUNCELOTWell, let his father be what a' will, we talk ofyoung Master Launcelot.GOBBOYour worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.LAUNCELOTBut I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,talk you of young Master Launcelot?GOBBOOf Launcelot, an't please your mastership.LAUNCELOTErgo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of MasterLauncelot, father; for the young gentleman,according to Fates and Destinies and such oddsayings, the Sisters Three and such branches oflearning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would sayin plain terms, gone to heaven.GOBBOMarry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of myage, my very prop.LAUNCELOTDo I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff ora prop? Do you know me, father?GOBBOAlack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest hissoul, alive or dead?LAUNCELOTDo you not know me, father?GOBBOAlack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.LAUNCELOTNay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail ofthe knowing me: it is a wise father that knows hisown child. Well, old man, I will tell you news ofyour son: give me your blessing: truth will cometo light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's sonmay, but at the length truth will out.GOBBOPray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are notLauncelot, my boy.LAUNCELOTPray you, let's have no more fooling about it, butgive me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boythat was, your son that is, your child that shallbe.GOBBOI cannot think you are my son.LAUNCELOTI know not what I shall think of that: but I amLauncelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery yourwife is my mother.GOBBOHer name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thoube Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thougot! thou hast got more hair on thy chin thanDobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.LAUNCELOTIt should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail growsbackward: I am sure he had more hair of his tailthan I have of my face when I last saw him.GOBBOLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thymaster agree? I have brought him a present. How'gree you now?LAUNCELOTWell, well: but, for mine own part, as I have setup my rest to run away, so I will not rest till Ihave run some ground. My master's a very Jew: givehim a present! give him a halter: I am famished inhis service; you may tell every finger I have withmy ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give meyour present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, Iwill run as far as God has any ground. O rarefortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for Iam a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followersBASSANIOYou may do so; but let it be so hasted that supperbe ready at the farthest by five of the clock.

What would you?LAUNCELOTServe you, sir.GOBBOThat is the very defect of the matter, sir.BASSANIOI know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,And hath preferr'd thee, if it be prefermentTo leave a rich Jew's service, to becomeThe follower of so poor a gentleman.LAUNCELOTThe old proverb is very well parted between mymaster Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace ofGod, sir, and he hath enough.BASSANIOThou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.Take leave of thy old master and inquireMy lodging out. Give him a liveryMore guarded than his fellows': see it done.LAUNCELOTFather, in. I cannot get a service, no; I havene'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man inItaly have a fairer table which doth offer to swearupon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifleof wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! elevenwidows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for oneman: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to bein peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be awoman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.Exeunt Launcelot and Old GobboBASSANIOI pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,Return in haste, for I do feast to-nightMy best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.LEONARDOMy best endeavours shall be done herein.Enter GRATIANOGRATIANOWhere is your master?LEONARDOYonder, sir, he walks.ExitGRATIANOSignior Bassanio!BASSANIOGratiano!GRATIANOI have a suit to you.BASSANIOYou have obtain'd it.GRATIANOYou must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.BASSANIOWhy then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;Parts that become thee happily enoughAnd in such eyes as ours appear not faults;But where thou art not known, why, there they showSomething too liberal. Pray thee, take painTo allay with some cold drops of modestyThy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviorI be misconstrued in the place I go to,And lose my hopes.GRATIANOSignior Bassanio, hear me:If I do not put on a sober habit,Talk with respect and swear but now and then,Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyesThus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'Use all the observance of civility,Like one well studied in a sad ostentTo please his grandam, never trust me more.BASSANIOWell, we shall see your bearing.GRATIANONay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge meBy what we do to-night.BASSANIONo, that were pity:I would entreat you rather to put onYour boldest suit of mirth, for we have friendsThat purpose merriment.

Most beautifulpagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not playthe knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,adieu: these foolish drops do something drown mymanly spirit: adieu.JESSICAFarewell, good Launcelot.Exit LauncelotAlack, what heinous sin is it in meTo be ashamed to be my father's child!But though I am a daughter to his blood,I am not to his manners.

But wherefore should I go?I am not bid for love; they flatter me:But yet I'll go in hate, to feed uponThe prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,Look to my house. I am right loath to go:There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,For I did dream of money-bags to-night.LAUNCELOTI beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expectyour reproach.SHYLOCKSo do I his.LAUNCELOTAn they have conspired together, I will not say youshall see a masque; but if you do, then it was notfor nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding onBlack-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was fouryear, in the afternoon.SHYLOCKWhat, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drumAnd the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,Clamber not you up to the casements then,Nor thrust your head into the public streetTo gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:Let not the sound of shallow foppery enterMy sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;Say I will come.LAUNCELOTI will go before, sir. Mistress, look out atwindow, for all this, There will come a Christianboy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.ExitSHYLOCKWhat says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?JESSICAHis words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.SHYLOCKThe patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by dayMore than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;Therefore I part with him, and part with himTo one that would have him help to wasteHis borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;Perhaps I will return immediately:Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:Fast bind, fast find;A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.ExitJESSICAFarewell; and if my fortune be not crost,I have a father, you a daughter, lost.ExitSCENE VI.

All things that are,Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.How like a younker or a prodigalThe scarfed bark puts from her native bay,Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!How like the prodigal doth she return,With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!SALARINOHere comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.Enter LORENZOLORENZOSweet friends, your patience for my long abode;Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,I'll watch as long for you then.

Let me see;I will survey the inscriptions back again.What says this leaden casket?'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?This casket threatens. Men that hazard allDo it in hope of fair advantages:A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.What says the silver with her virgin hue?'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,And weigh thy value with an even hand:If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enoughMay not extend so far as to the lady:And yet to be afeard of my deservingWere but a weak disabling of myself.As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,In graces and in qualities of breeding;But more than these, in love I do deserve.What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?Let's see once more this saying graved in gold'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;From the four corners of the earth they come,To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wildsOf wide Arabia are as thoroughfares nowFor princes to come view fair Portia:The watery kingdom, whose ambitious headSpits in the face of heaven, is no barTo stop the foreign spirits, but they come,As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.One of these three contains her heavenly picture.Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnationTo think so base a thought: it were too grossTo rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.Or shall I think in silver she's immured,Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?O sinful thought! Never so rich a gemWas set in worse than gold. They have in EnglandA coin that bears the figure of an angelStamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;But here an angel in a golden bedLies all within.

I'll read the writing.ReadsAll that glitters is not gold;Often have you heard that told:Many a man his life hath soldBut my outside to behold:Gilded tombs do worms enfold.Had you been as wise as bold,Young in limbs, in judgment old,Your answer had not been inscroll'd:Fare you well; your suit is cold.Cold, indeed; and labour lost:Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!Portia, adieu.

O my ducats! O my daughter!Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'SALARINOWhy, all the boys in Venice follow him,Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.SALANIOLet good Antonio look he keep his day,Or he shall pay for this.SALARINOMarry, well remember'd.I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,Who told me, in the narrow seas that partThe French and English, there miscarriedA vessel of our country richly fraught:I thought upon Antonio when he told me;And wish'd in silence that it were not his.SALANIOYou were best to tell Antonio what you hear;Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.SALARINOA kinder gentleman treads not the earth.I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:Bassanio told him he would make some speedOf his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;Slubber not business for my sake, BassanioBut stay the very riping of the time;And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,Let it not enter in your mind of love:Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughtsTo courtship and such fair ostents of loveAs shall conveniently become you there:'And even there, his eye being big with tears,Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,And with affection wondrous sensibleHe wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.SALANIOI think he only loves the world for him.I pray thee, let us go and find him outAnd quicken his embraced heavinessWith some delight or other.SALARINODo we so.ExeuntSCENE IX.

Fortune nowTo my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'What many men desire! that 'many' may be meantBy the fool multitude, that choose by show,Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,Builds in the weather on the outward wall,Even in the force and road of casualty.I will not choose what many men desire,Because I will not jump with common spiritsAnd rank me with the barbarous multitudes.Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'And well said too; for who shall go aboutTo cozen fortune and be honourableWithout the stamp of merit? Let none presumeTo wear an undeserved dignity.O, that estates, degrees and officesWere not derived corruptly, and that clear honourWere purchased by the merit of the wearer!How many then should cover that stand bare!How many be commanded that command!How much low peasantry would then be glean'dFrom the true seed of honour! and how much honourPick'd from the chaff and ruin of the timesTo be new-varnish'd!

A street.Enter SALANIO and SALARINOSALANIONow, what news on the Rialto?SALARINOWhy, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hatha ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a verydangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of manya tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossipReport be an honest woman of her word.SALANIOI would she were as lying a gossip in that as everknapped ginger or made her neighbours believe shewept for the death of a third husband. But it istrue, without any slips of prolixity or crossing theplain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, thehonest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enoughto keep his name company!--SALARINOCome, the full stop.SALANIOHa! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hathlost a ship.SALARINOI would it might prove the end of his losses.SALANIOLet me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross myprayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.Enter SHYLOCKHow now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?SHYLOCKYou know, none so well, none so well as you, of mydaughter's flight.SALARINOThat's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailorthat made the wings she flew withal.SALANIOAnd Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird wasfledged; and then it is the complexion of them allto leave the dam.SHYLOCKShe is damned for it.SALANIOThat's certain, if the devil may be her judge.SHYLOCKMy own flesh and blood to rebel!SALANIOOut upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?SHYLOCKI say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.SALARINOThere is more difference between thy flesh and hersthan between jet and ivory; more between your bloodsthan there is between red wine and rhenish. Buttell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had anyloss at sea or no?SHYLOCKThere I have another bad match: a bankrupt, aprodigal, who dare scarce show his head on theRialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug uponthe mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont tocall me usurer; let him look to his bond: he waswont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let himlook to his bond.SALARINOWhy, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not takehis flesh: what's that good for?SHYLOCKTo bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, andhindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted mybargains, cooled my friends, heated mineenemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hathnot a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed withthe same food, hurt with the same weapons, subjectto the same diseases, healed by the same means,warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, asa Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poisonus, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we notrevenge? If we are like you in the rest, we willresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christianwrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be byChristian example? Why, revenge. The villany youteach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but Iwill better the instruction.Enter a ServantServantGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house anddesires to speak with you both.SALARINOWe have been up and down to seek him.Enter TUBALSALANIOHere comes another of the tribe: a third cannot bematched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and ServantSHYLOCKHow now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thoufound my daughter?TUBALI often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.SHYLOCKWhy, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The cursenever fell upon our nation till now; I never felt ittill now: two thousand ducats in that; and otherprecious, precious jewels. I would my daughterwere dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats inher coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I knownot what's spent in the search: why, thou loss uponloss! the thief gone with so much, and so much tofind the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:nor no in luck stirring but what lights on myshoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tearsbut of my shedding.TUBALYes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as Iheard in Genoa,--SHYLOCKWhat, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?TUBALHath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.SHYLOCKI thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?TUBALI spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.SHYLOCKI thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!ha, ha! where? in Genoa?TUBALYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in onenight fourscore ducats.SHYLOCKThou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see mygold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!fourscore ducats!TUBALThere came divers of Antonio's creditors in mycompany to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.SHYLOCKI am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torturehim: I am glad of it.TUBALOne of them showed me a ring that he had of yourdaughter for a monkey.SHYLOCKOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was myturquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.TUBALBut Antonio is certainly undone.SHYLOCKNay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, feeme an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. Iwill have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, werehe out of Venice, I can make what merchandise Iwill. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.ExeuntSCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and AttendantsPORTIAI pray you, tarry: pause a day or twoBefore you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.There's something tells me, but it is not love,I would not lose you; and you know yourself,Hate counsels not in such a quality.But lest you should not understand me well,--And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--I would detain you here some month or twoBefore you venture for me. I could teach youHow to choose right, but I am then forsworn;So will I never be: so may you miss me;But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;One half of me is yours, the other half yours,Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,And so all yours. O, these naughty timesPut bars between the owners and their rights!And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,To eke it and to draw it out in length,To stay you from election.BASSANIOLet me chooseFor as I am, I live upon the rack.PORTIAUpon the rack, Bassanio! then confessWhat treason there is mingled with your love.BASSANIONone but that ugly treason of mistrust,Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:There may as well be amity and life'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.PORTIAAy, but I fear you speak upon the rack,Where men enforced do speak anything.BASSANIOPromise me life, and I'll confess the truth.PORTIAWell then, confess and live.BASSANIO'Confess' and 'love'Had been the very sum of my confession:O happy torment, when my torturerDoth teach me answers for deliverance!But let me to my fortune and the caskets.PORTIAAway, then! I am lock'd in one of them:If you do love me, you will find me out.Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.Let music sound while he doth make his choice;Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,Fading in music: that the comparisonMay stand more proper, my eye shall be the streamAnd watery death-bed for him. He may win;And what is music then? Then music isEven as the flourish when true subjects bowTo a new-crowned monarch: such it isAs are those dulcet sounds in break of dayThat creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,With no less presence, but with much more love,Than young Alcides, when he did redeemThe virgin tribute paid by howling TroyTo the sea-monster: I stand for sacrificeThe rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,With bleared visages, come forth to viewThe issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismayI view the fight than thou that makest the fray.Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himselfSONG.Tell me where is fancy bred,Or in the heart, or in the head?How begot, how nourished?Reply, reply.It is engender'd in the eyes,With gazing fed; and fancy diesIn the cradle where it lies.Let us all ring fancy's knellI'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.ALLDing, dong, bell.BASSANIOSo may the outward shows be least themselves:The world is still deceived with ornament.In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,Obscures the show of evil? In religion,What damned error, but some sober browWill bless it and approve it with a text,Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?There is no vice so simple but assumesSome mark of virtue on his outward parts:How many cowards, whose hearts are all as falseAs stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chinsThe beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;And these assume but valour's excrementTo render them redoubted! Look on beauty,And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;Which therein works a miracle in nature,Making them lightest that wear most of it:So are those crisped snaky golden locksWhich make such wanton gambols with the wind,Upon supposed fairness, often knownTo be the dowry of a second head,The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.Thus ornament is but the guiled shoreTo a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarfVeiling an Indian beauty; in a word,The seeming truth which cunning times put onTo entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;And here choose I; joy be the consequence!PORTIA[Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,For fear I surfeit.BASSANIOWhat find I here?Opening the leaden casketFair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-godHath come so near creation? Move these eyes?Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a barShould sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairsThe painter plays the spider and hath wovenA golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--How could he see to do them? having made one,Methinks it should have power to steal both hisAnd leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how farThe substance of my praise doth wrong this shadowIn underprizing it, so far this shadowDoth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,The continent and summary of my fortune.ReadsYou that choose not by the view,Chance as fair and choose as true!Since this fortune falls to you,Be content and seek no new,If you be well pleased with thisAnd hold your fortune for your bliss,Turn you where your lady isAnd claim her with a loving kiss.A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;I come by note, to give and to receive.Like one of two contending in a prize,That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,Hearing applause and universal shout,Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubtWhether these pearls of praise be his or no;So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;As doubtful whether what I see be true,Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.PORTIAYou see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,Such as I am: though for myself aloneI would not be ambitious in my wish,To wish myself much better; yet, for youI would be trebled twenty times myself;A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;That only to stand high in your account,I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,Exceed account; but the full sum of meIs sum of something, which, to term in gross,Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;Happy in this, she is not yet so oldBut she may learn; happier than this,She is not bred so dull but she can learn;Happiest of all is that her gentle spiritCommits itself to yours to be directed,As from her lord, her governor, her king.Myself and what is mine to you and yoursIs now converted: but now I was the lordOf this fair mansion, master of my servants,Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,This house, these servants and this same myselfAre yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;Which when you part from, lose, or give away,Let it presage the ruin of your loveAnd be my vantage to exclaim on you.BASSANIOMadam, you have bereft me of all words,Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;And there is such confusion in my powers,As after some oration fairly spokeBy a beloved prince, there doth appearAmong the buzzing pleased multitude;Where every something, being blent together,Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,Express'd and not express'd. But when this ringParts from this finger, then parts life from hence:O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!NERISSAMy lord and lady, it is now our time,That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!GRATIANOMy lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,I wish you all the joy that you can wish;For I am sure you can wish none from me:And when your honours mean to solemnizeThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,Even at that time I may be married too.BASSANIOWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.GRATIANOI thank your lordship, you have got me one.My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;You loved, I loved for intermission.No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.Your fortune stood upon the casket there,And so did mine too, as the matter falls;For wooing here until I sweat again,And sweating until my very roof was dryWith oaths of love, at last, if promise last,I got a promise of this fair one hereTo have her love, provided that your fortuneAchieved her mistress.PORTIAIs this true, Nerissa?NERISSAMadam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.BASSANIOAnd do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?GRATIANOYes, faith, my lord.BASSANIOOur feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.GRATIANOWe'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.NERISSAWhat, and stake down?GRATIANONo; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,and my old Venetian friend Salerio?Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from VeniceBASSANIOLorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;If that the youth of my new interest hereHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,I bid my very friends and countrymen,Sweet Portia, welcome.PORTIASo do I, my lord:They are entirely welcome.LORENZOI thank your honour. For my part, my lord,My purpose was not to have seen you here;But meeting with Salerio by the way,He did entreat me, past all saying nay,To come with him along.SALERIOI did, my lord;And I have reason for it. Signior AntonioCommends him to you.Gives Bassanio a letterBASSANIOEre I ope his letter,I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.SALERIONot sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;Nor well, unless in mind: his letter thereWill show you his estate.GRATIANONerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?I know he will be glad of our success;We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.SALERIOI would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.PORTIAThere are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the worldCould turn so much the constitutionOf any constant man. What, worse and worse!With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,And I must freely have the half of anythingThat this same paper brings you.BASSANIOO sweet Portia,Here are a few of the unpleasant'st wordsThat ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,When I did first impart my love to you,I freely told you, all the wealth I hadRan in my veins, I was a gentleman;And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,Rating myself at nothing, you shall seeHow much I was a braggart. When I told youMy state was nothing, I should then have told youThat I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,I have engaged myself to a dear friend,Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;The paper as the body of my friend,And every word in it a gaping wound,Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,From Lisbon, Barbary and India?And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touchOf merchant-marring rocks?SALERIONot one, my lord.Besides, it should appear, that if he hadThe present money to discharge the Jew,He would not take it. Never did I knowA creature, that did bear the shape of man,So keen and greedy to confound a man:He plies the duke at morning and at night,And doth impeach the freedom of the state,If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,The duke himself, and the magnificoesOf greatest port, have all persuaded with him;But none can drive him from the envious pleaOf forfeiture, of justice and his bond.JESSICAWhen I was with him I have heard him swearTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,That he would rather have Antonio's fleshThan twenty times the value of the sumThat he did owe him: and I know, my lord,If law, authority and power deny not,It will go hard with poor Antonio.PORTIAIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?BASSANIOThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,The best-condition'd and unwearied spiritIn doing courtesies, and one in whomThe ancient Roman honour more appearsThan any that draws breath in Italy.PORTIAWhat sum owes he the Jew?BASSANIOFor me three thousand ducats.PORTIAWhat, no more?Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;Double six thousand, and then treble that,Before a friend of this descriptionShall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.First go with me to church and call me wife,And then away to Venice to your friend;For never shall you lie by Portia's sideWith an unquiet soul. You shall have goldTo pay the petty debt twenty times over:When it is paid, bring your true friend along.My maid Nerissa and myself meantimeWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.But let me hear the letter of your friend.BASSANIO[Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have allmiscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate isvery low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and sincein paying it, it is impossible I should live, alldebts are cleared between you and I, if I might butsee you at my death. Notwithstanding, use yourpleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,let not my letter.PORTIAO love, dispatch all business, and be gone!BASSANIOSince I have your good leave to go away,I will make haste: but, till I come again,No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.ExeuntSCENE III. Venice. A street.Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and GaolerSHYLOCKGaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;This is the fool that lent out money gratis:Gaoler, look to him.ANTONIOHear me yet, good Shylock.SHYLOCKI'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fondTo come abroad with him at his request.ANTONIOI pray thee, hear me speak.SHYLOCKI'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yieldTo Christian intercessors. Follow not;I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.ExitSALARINOIt is the most impenetrable curThat ever kept with men.ANTONIOLet him alone:I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.He seeks my life; his reason well I know:I oft deliver'd from his forfeituresMany that have at times made moan to me;Therefore he hates me.SALARINOI am sure the dukeWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.ANTONIOThe duke cannot deny the course of law:For the commodity that strangers haveWith us in Venice, if it be denied,Will much impeach the justice of his state;Since that the trade and profit of the cityConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:These griefs and losses have so bated me,That I shall hardly spare a pound of fleshTo-morrow to my bloody creditor.Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio comeTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not!ExeuntSCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASARLORENZOMadam, although I speak it in your presence,You have a noble and a true conceitOf godlike amity; which appears most stronglyIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.But if you knew to whom you show this honour,How true a gentleman you send relief,How dear a lover of my lord your husband,I know you would be prouder of the workThan customary bounty can enforce you.PORTIAI never did repent for doing good,Nor shall not now: for in companionsThat do converse and waste the time together,Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,There must be needs a like proportionOf lineaments, of manners and of spirit;Which makes me think that this Antonio,Being the bosom lover of my lord,Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,How little is the cost I have bestow'dIn purchasing the semblance of my soulFrom out the state of hellish misery!This comes too near the praising of myself;Therefore no more of it: hear other things.Lorenzo, I commit into your handsThe husbandry and manage of my houseUntil my lord's return: for mine own part,I have toward heaven breathed a secret vowTo live in prayer and contemplation,Only attended by Nerissa here,Until her husband and my lord's return:There is a monastery two miles off;And there will we abide. I do desire youNot to deny this imposition;The which my love and some necessityNow lays upon you.LORENZOMadam, with all my heart;I shall obey you in all fair commands.PORTIAMy people do already know my mind,And will acknowledge you and JessicaIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.And so farewell, till we shall meet again.LORENZOFair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!JESSICAI wish your ladyship all heart's content.PORTIAI thank you for your wish, and am well pleasedTo wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZONow, Balthasar,As I have ever found thee honest-true,So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,And use thou all the endeavour of a manIn speed to Padua: see thou render thisInto my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speedUnto the tranect, to the common ferryWhich trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.BALTHASARMadam, I go with all convenient speed.ExitPORTIACome on, Nerissa; I have work in handThat you yet know not of: we'll see our husbandsBefore they think of us.NERISSAShall they see us?PORTIAThey shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,That they shall think we are accomplishedWith that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,When we are both accoutred like young men,I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,And wear my dagger with the braver grace,And speak between the change of man and boyWith a reed voice, and turn two mincing stepsInto a manly stride, and speak of fraysLike a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,How honourable ladies sought my love,Which I denying, they fell sick and died;I could not do withal; then I'll repent,And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,That men shall swear I have discontinued schoolAbove a twelvemonth. I have within my mindA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,Which I will practise.NERISSAWhy, shall we turn to men?PORTIAFie, what a question's that,If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!But come, I'll tell thee all my whole deviceWhen I am in my coach, which stays for usAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,For we must measure twenty miles to-day.ExeuntSCENE V. The same. A garden.Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICALAUNCELOTYes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the fatherare to be laid upon the children: therefore, Ipromise ye, I fear you. I was always plain withyou, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think youare damned. There is but one hope in it that can doyou any good; and that is but a kind of bastardhope neither.JESSICAAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?LAUNCELOTMarry, you may partly hope that your father got younot, that you are not the Jew's daughter.JESSICAThat were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so thesins of my mother should be visited upon me.LAUNCELOTTruly then I fear you are damned both by father andmother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, Ifall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you aregone both ways.JESSICAI shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me aChristian.LAUNCELOTTruly, the more to blame he: we were Christiansenow before; e'en as many as could well live, one byanother. This making Christians will raise theprice of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, weshall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.Enter LORENZOJESSICAI'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.LORENZOI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, ifyou thus get my wife into corners.JESSICANay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and Iare out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy forme in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and hesays, you are no good member of the commonwealth,for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise theprice of pork.LORENZOI shall answer that better to the commonwealth thanyou can the getting up of the negro's belly: theMoor is with child by you, Launcelot.LAUNCELOTIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason:but if she be less than an honest woman, she isindeed more than I took her for.LORENZOHow every fool can play upon the word! I think thebest grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,and discourse grow commendable in none only butparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.LAUNCELOTThat is done, sir; they have all stomachs.LORENZOGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bidthem prepare dinner.LAUNCELOTThat is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.LORENZOWill you cover then, sir?LAUNCELOTNot so, sir, neither; I know my duty.LORENZOYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou showthe whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I praytree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, servein the meat, and we will come in to dinner.LAUNCELOTFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for themeat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming into dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours andconceits shall govern.ExitLORENZOO dear discretion, how his words are suited!The fool hath planted in his memoryAn army of good words; and I do knowA many fools, that stand in better place,Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy wordDefy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?JESSICAPast all expressing. It is very meetThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life;For, having such a blessing in his lady,He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;And if on earth he do not mean it, thenIn reason he should never come to heavenWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly matchAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,And Portia one, there must be something elsePawn'd with the other, for the poor rude worldHath not her fellow.LORENZOEven such a husbandHast thou of me as she is for a wife.JESSICANay, but ask my opinion too of that.LORENZOI will anon: first, let us go to dinner.JESSICANay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.LORENZONo, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other thingsI shall digest it.JESSICAWell, I'll set you forth.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and othersDUKEWhat, is Antonio here?ANTONIOReady, so please your grace.DUKEI am sorry for thee: thou art come to answerA stony adversary, an inhuman wretchuncapable of pity, void and emptyFrom any dram of mercy.ANTONIOI have heardYour grace hath ta'en great pains to qualifyHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurateAnd that no lawful means can carry meOut of his envy's reach, I do opposeMy patience to his fury, and am arm'dTo suffer, with a quietness of spirit,The very tyranny and rage of his.DUKEGo one, and call the Jew into the court.SALERIOHe is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.Enter SHYLOCKDUKEMake room, and let him stand before our face.Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy maliceTo the last hour of act; and then 'tis thoughtThou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strangeThan is thy strange apparent cruelty;And where thou now exact'st the penalty,Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,Forgive a moiety of the principal;Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,That have of late so huddled on his back,Enow to press a royal merchant downAnd pluck commiseration of his stateFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'dTo offices of tender courtesy.We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.SHYLOCKI have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;And by our holy Sabbath have I swornTo have the due and forfeit of my bond:If you deny it, let the danger lightUpon your charter and your city's freedom.You'll ask me, why I rather choose to haveA weight of carrion flesh than to receiveThree thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?What if my house be troubled with a ratAnd I be pleased to give ten thousand ducatsTo have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?Some men there are love not a gaping pig;Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,Cannot contain their urine: for affection,Mistress of passion, sways it to the moodOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:As there is no firm reason to be render'd,Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;Why he, a harmless necessary cat;Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of forceMust yield to such inevitable shameAs to offend, himself being offended;So can I give no reason, nor I will not,More than a lodged hate and a certain loathingI bear Antonio, that I follow thusA losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?BASSANIOThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,To excuse the current of thy cruelty.SHYLOCKI am not bound to please thee with my answers.BASSANIODo all men kill the things they do not love?SHYLOCKHates any man the thing he would not kill?BASSANIOEvery offence is not a hate at first.SHYLOCKWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?ANTONIOI pray you, think you question with the Jew:You may as well go stand upon the beachAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;You may as well use question with the wolfWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;You may as well forbid the mountain pinesTo wag their high tops and to make no noise,When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;You may as well do anything most hard,As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,Make no more offers, use no farther means,But with all brief and plain conveniencyLet me have judgment and the Jew his will.BASSANIOFor thy three thousand ducats here is six.SHYLOCKWhat judgment shall I dread, doingWere in six parts and every part a ducat,I would not draw them; I would have my bond.DUKEHow shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?SHYLOCKWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?You have among you many a purchased slave,Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,You use in abject and in slavish parts,Because you bought them: shall I say to you,Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?Why sweat they under burthens? let their bedsBe made as soft as yours and let their palatesBe season'd with such viands? You will answer'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.If you deny me, fie upon your law!There is no force in the decrees of Venice.I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?DUKEUpon my power I may dismiss this court,Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,Whom I have sent for to determine this,Come here to-day.SALERIOMy lord, here stays withoutA messenger with letters from the doctor,New come from Padua.DUKEBring us the letter; call the messenger.BASSANIOGood cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.ANTONIOI am a tainted wether of the flock,Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruitDrops earliest to the ground; and so let meYou cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,Than to live still and write mine epitaph.Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerkDUKECame you from Padua, from Bellario?NERISSAFrom both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.Presenting a letterBASSANIOWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?SHYLOCKTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.GRATIANONot on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keennessOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?SHYLOCKNo, none that thou hast wit enough to make.GRATIANOO, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!And for thy life let justice be accused.Thou almost makest me waver in my faithTo hold opinion with Pythagoras,That souls of animals infuse themselvesInto the trunks of men: thy currish spiritGovern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,Infused itself in thee; for thy desiresAre wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.SHYLOCKTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fallTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.DUKEThis letter from Bellario doth commendA young and learned doctor to our court.Where is he?NERISSAHe attendeth here hard by,To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.DUKEWith all my heart. Some three or four of youGo give him courteous conduct to this place.Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.Clerk[Reads]Your grace shall understand that at the receipt ofyour letter I am very sick: but in the instant thatyour messenger came, in loving visitation was withme a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. Iacquainted him with the cause in controversy betweenthe Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'ermany books together: he is furnished with myopinion; which, bettered with his own learning, thegreatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comeswith him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace'srequest in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack ofyears be no impediment to let him lack a reverendestimation; for I never knew so young a body with soold a head. I leave him to your graciousacceptance, whose trial shall better publish hiscommendation.DUKEYou hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:And here, I take it, is the doctor come.Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of lawsGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?PORTIAI did, my lord.DUKEYou are welcome: take your place.Are you acquainted with the differenceThat holds this present question in the court?PORTIAI am informed thoroughly of the cause.Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?DUKEAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.PORTIAIs your name Shylock?SHYLOCKShylock is my name.PORTIAOf a strange nature is the suit you follow;Yet in such rule that the Venetian lawCannot impugn you as you do proceed.You stand within his danger, do you not?ANTONIOAy, so he says.PORTIADo you confess the bond?ANTONIOI do.PORTIAThen must the Jew be merciful.SHYLOCKOn what compulsion must I? tell me that.PORTIAThe quality of mercy is not strain'd,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenUpon the place beneath: it is twice blest;It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomesThe throned monarch better than his crown;His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,The attribute to awe and majesty,Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;But mercy is above this sceptred sway;It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,It is an attribute to God himself;And earthly power doth then show likest God'sWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,Though justice be thy plea, consider this,That, in the course of justice, none of usShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;And that same prayer doth teach us all to renderThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus muchTo mitigate the justice of thy plea;Which if thou follow, this strict court of VeniceMust needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.SHYLOCKMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,The penalty and forfeit of my bond.PORTIAIs he not able to discharge the money?BASSANIOYes, here I tender it for him in the court;Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:If this will not suffice, it must appearThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,Wrest once the law to your authority:To do a great right, do a little wrong,And curb this cruel devil of his will.PORTIAIt must not be; there is no power in VeniceCan alter a decree established:'Twill be recorded for a precedent,And many an error by the same exampleWill rush into the state: it cannot be.SHYLOCKA Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!PORTIAI pray you, let me look upon the bond.SHYLOCKHere 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.PORTIAShylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.SHYLOCKAn oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?No, not for Venice.PORTIAWhy, this bond is forfeit;And lawfully by this the Jew may claimA pound of flesh, to be by him cut offNearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.SHYLOCKWhen it is paid according to the tenor.It doth appear you are a worthy judge;You know the law, your expositionHath been most sound: I charge you by the law,Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swearThere is no power in the tongue of manTo alter me: I stay here on my bond.ANTONIOMost heartily I do beseech the courtTo give the judgment.PORTIAWhy then, thus it is:You must prepare your bosom for his knife.SHYLOCKO noble judge! O excellent young man!PORTIAFor the intent and purpose of the lawHath full relation to the penalty,Which here appeareth due upon the bond.SHYLOCK'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!How much more elder art thou than thy looks!PORTIATherefore lay bare your bosom.SHYLOCKAy, his breast:So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.PORTIAIt is so. Are there balance here to weighThe flesh?SHYLOCKI have them ready.PORTIAHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.SHYLOCKIs it so nominated in the bond?PORTIAIt is not so express'd: but what of that?'Twere good you do so much for charity.SHYLOCKI cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.PORTIAYou, merchant, have you any thing to say?ANTONIOBut little: I am arm'd and well prepared.Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;For herein Fortune shows herself more kindThan is her custom: it is still her useTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,To view with hollow eye and wrinkled browAn age of poverty; from which lingering penanceOf such misery doth she cut me off.Commend me to your honourable wife:Tell her the process of Antonio's end;Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;And, when the tale is told, bid her be judgeWhether Bassanio had not once a love.Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,And he repents not that he pays your debt;For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,I'll pay it presently with all my heart.BASSANIOAntonio, I am married to a wifeWhich is as dear to me as life itself;But life itself, my wife, and all the world,Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them allHere to this devil, to deliver you.PORTIAYour wife would give you little thanks for that,If she were by, to hear you make the offer.GRATIANOI have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:I would she were in heaven, so she couldEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.NERISSA'Tis well you offer it behind her back;The wish would make else an unquiet house.SHYLOCKThese be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;Would any of the stock of BarrabasHad been her husband rather than a Christian!AsideWe trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.PORTIAA pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:The court awards it, and the law doth give it.SHYLOCKMost rightful judge!PORTIAAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast:The law allows it, and the court awards it.SHYLOCKMost learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!PORTIATarry a little; there is something else.This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shedOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goodsAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscateUnto the state of Venice.GRATIANOO upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!SHYLOCKIs that the law?PORTIAThyself shalt see the act:For, as thou urgest justice, be assuredThou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.GRATIANOO learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!SHYLOCKI take this offer, then; pay the bond thriceAnd let the Christian go.BASSANIOHere is the money.PORTIASoft!The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:He shall have nothing but the penalty.GRATIANOO Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!PORTIATherefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor moreBut just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st moreOr less than a just pound, be it but so muchAs makes it light or heavy in the substance,Or the division of the twentieth partOf one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turnBut in the estimation of a hair,Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.GRATIANOA second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.PORTIAWhy doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.SHYLOCKGive me my principal, and let me go.BASSANIOI have it ready for thee; here it is.PORTIAHe hath refused it in the open court:He shall have merely justice and his bond.GRATIANOA Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.SHYLOCKShall I not have barely my principal?PORTIAThou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.SHYLOCKWhy, then the devil give him good of it!I'll stay no longer question.PORTIATarry, Jew:The law hath yet another hold on you.It is enacted in the laws of Venice,If it be proved against an alienThat by direct or indirect attemptsHe seek the life of any citizen,The party 'gainst the which he doth contriveShall seize one half his goods; the other halfComes to the privy coffer of the state;And the offender's life lies in the mercyOf the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;For it appears, by manifest proceeding,That indirectly and directly tooThou hast contrived against the very lifeOf the defendant; and thou hast incurr'dThe danger formerly by me rehearsed.Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.GRATIANOBeg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,Thou hast not left the value of a cord;Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.DUKEThat thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;The other half comes to the general state,Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.PORTIAAy, for the state, not for Antonio.SHYLOCKNay, take my life and all; pardon not that:You take my house when you do take the propThat doth sustain my house; you take my lifeWhen you do take the means whereby I live.PORTIAWhat mercy can you render him, Antonio?GRATIANOA halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.ANTONIOSo please my lord the duke and all the courtTo quit the fine for one half of his goods,I am content; so he will let me haveThe other half in use, to render it,Upon his death, unto the gentlemanThat lately stole his daughter:Two things provided more, that, for this favour,He presently become a Christian;The other, that he do record a gift,Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.DUKEHe shall do this, or else I do recantThe pardon that I late pronounced here.PORTIAArt thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?SHYLOCKI am content.PORTIAClerk, draw a deed of gift.SHYLOCKI pray you, give me leave to go from hence;I am not well: send the deed after me,And I will sign it.DUKEGet thee gone, but do it.GRATIANOIn christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.Exit SHYLOCKDUKESir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.PORTIAI humbly do desire your grace of pardon:I must away this night toward Padua,And it is meet I presently set forth.DUKEI am sorry that your leisure serves you not.Antonio, gratify this gentleman,For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.Exeunt Duke and his trainBASSANIOMost worthy gentleman, I and my friendHave by your wisdom been this day acquittedOf grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,We freely cope your courteous pains withal.ANTONIOAnd stand indebted, over and above,In love and service to you evermore.PORTIAHe is well paid that is well satisfied;And I, delivering you, am satisfiedAnd therein do account myself well paid:My mind was never yet more mercenary.I pray you, know me when we meet again:I wish you well, and so I take my leave.BASSANIODear sir, of force I must attempt you further:Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,Not to deny me, and to pardon me.PORTIAYou press me far, and therefore I will yield.To ANTONIOGive me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;To BASSANIOAnd, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;And you in love shall not deny me this.BASSANIOThis ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!I will not shame myself to give you this.PORTIAI will have nothing else but only this;And now methinks I have a mind to it.BASSANIOThere's more depends on this than on the value.The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,And find it out by proclamation:Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.PORTIAI see, sir, you are liberal in offersYou taught me first to beg; and now methinksYou teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.BASSANIOGood sir, this ring was given me by my wife;And when she put it on, she made me vowThat I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.PORTIAThat 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.An if your wife be not a mad-woman,And know how well I have deserved the ring,She would not hold out enemy for ever,For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!Exeunt Portia and NerissaANTONIOMy Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:Let his deservings and my love withalBe valued against your wife's commandment.BASSANIOGo, Gratiano, run and overtake him;Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.Exit GratianoCome, you and I will thither presently;And in the morning early will we bothFly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.ExeuntSCENE II. The same. A street.Enter PORTIA and NERISSAPORTIAInquire the Jew's house out, give him this deedAnd let him sign it: we'll away to-nightAnd be a day before our husbands home:This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.Enter GRATIANOGRATIANOFair sir, you are well o'erta'enMy Lord Bassanio upon more adviceHath sent you here this ring, and doth entreatYour company at dinner.PORTIAThat cannot be:His ring I do accept most thankfully:And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.GRATIANOThat will I do.NERISSASir, I would speak with you.Aside to PORTIAI'll see if I can get my husband's ring,Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.PORTIA[Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.We shall have old swearingThat they did give the rings away to men;But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.AloudAway! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.NERISSACome, good sir, will you show me to this house?ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.Enter LORENZO and JESSICALORENZOThe moon shines bright: in such a night as this,When the sweet wind did gently kiss the treesAnd they did make no noise, in such a nightTroilus methinks mounted the Troyan wallsAnd sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,Where Cressid lay that night.JESSICAIn such a nightDid Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dewAnd saw the lion's shadow ere himselfAnd ran dismay'd away.LORENZOIn such a nightStood Dido with a willow in her handUpon the wild sea banks and waft her loveTo come again to Carthage.JESSICAIn such a nightMedea gather'd the enchanted herbsThat did renew old AEson.LORENZOIn such a nightDid Jessica steal from the wealthy JewAnd with an unthrift love did run from VeniceAs far as Belmont.JESSICAIn such a nightDid young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,Stealing her soul with many vows of faithAnd ne'er a true one.LORENZOIn such a nightDid pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,Slander her love, and he forgave it her.JESSICAI would out-night you, did no body come;But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.Enter STEPHANOLORENZOWho comes so fast in silence of the night?STEPHANOA friend.LORENZOA friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?STEPHANOStephano is my name; and I bring wordMy mistress will before the break of dayBe here at Belmont; she doth stray aboutBy holy crosses, where she kneels and praysFor happy wedlock hours.LORENZOWho comes with her?STEPHANONone but a holy hermit and her maid.I pray you, is my master yet return'd?LORENZOHe is not, nor we have not heard from him.But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,And ceremoniously let us prepareSome welcome for the mistress of the house.Enter LAUNCELOTLAUNCELOTSola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!LORENZOWho calls?LAUNCELOTSola! did you see Master Lorenzo?Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!LORENZOLeave hollaing, man: here.LAUNCELOTSola! where? where?LORENZOHere.LAUNCELOTTell him there's a post come from my master, withhis horn full of good news: my master will be hereere morning.ExitLORENZOSweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.And yet no matter: why should we go in?My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,Within the house, your mistress is at hand;And bring your music forth into the air.Exit StephanoHow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!Here will we sit and let the sounds of musicCreep in our ears: soft stillness and the nightBecome the touches of sweet harmony.Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heavenIs thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'stBut in his motion like an angel sings,Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;Such harmony is in immortal souls;But whilst this muddy vesture of decayDoth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.Enter MusiciansCome, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,And draw her home with music.MusicJESSICAI am never merry when I hear sweet music.LORENZOThe reason is, your spirits are attentive:For do but note a wild and wanton herd,Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,Which is the hot condition of their blood;If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,Or any air of music touch their ears,You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gazeBy the sweet power of music: therefore the poetDid feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,But music for the time doth change his nature.The man that hath no music in himself,Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;The motions of his spirit are dull as nightAnd his affections dark as Erebus:Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.Enter PORTIA and NERISSAPORTIAThat light we see is burning in my hall.How far that little candle throws his beams!So shines a good deed in a naughty world.NERISSAWhen the moon shone, we did not see the candle.PORTIASo doth the greater glory dim the less:A substitute shines brightly as a kingUnto the king be by, and then his stateEmpties itself, as doth an inland brookInto the main of waters. Music! hark!NERISSAIt is your music, madam, of the house.PORTIANothing is good, I see, without respect:Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.NERISSASilence bestows that virtue on it, madam.PORTIAThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,When neither is attended, and I thinkThe nightingale, if she should sing by day,When every goose is cackling, would be thoughtNo better a musician than the wren.How many things by season season'd areTo their right praise and true perfection!Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with EndymionAnd would not be awaked.Music ceasesLORENZOThat is the voice,Or I am much deceived, of Portia.PORTIAHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,By the bad voice.LORENZODear lady, welcome home.PORTIAWe have been praying for our husbands' healths,Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.Are they return'd?LORENZOMadam, they are not yet;But there is come a messenger before,To signify their coming.PORTIAGo in, Nerissa;Give order to my servants that they takeNo note at all of our being absent hence;Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.A tucket soundsLORENZOYour husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.PORTIAThis night methinks is but the daylight sick;It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,Such as the day is when the sun is hid.Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followersBASSANIOWe should hold day with the Antipodes,If you would walk in absence of the sun.PORTIALet me give light, but let me not be light;For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,And never be Bassanio so for me:But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.BASSANIOI thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.This is the man, this is Antonio,To whom I am so infinitely bound.PORTIAYou should in all sense be much bound to him.For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.ANTONIONo more than I am well acquitted of.PORTIASir, you are very welcome to our house:It must appear in other ways than words,Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.GRATIANO[To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.PORTIAA quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?GRATIANOAbout a hoop of gold, a paltry ringThat she did give me, whose posy wasFor all the world like cutler's poetryUpon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'NERISSAWhat talk you of the posy or the value?You swore to me, when I did give it you,That you would wear it till your hour of deathAnd that it should lie with you in your grave:Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,You should have been respective and have kept it.Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.GRATIANOHe will, an if he live to be a man.NERISSAAy, if a woman live to be a man.GRATIANONow, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:I could not for my heart deny it him.PORTIAYou were to blame, I must be plain with you,To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:A thing stuck on with oaths upon your fingerAnd so riveted with faith unto your flesh.I gave my love a ring and made him swearNever to part with it; and here he stands;I dare be sworn for him he would not leave itNor pluck it from his finger, for the wealthThat the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.BASSANIO[Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand offAnd swear I lost the ring defending it.GRATIANOMy Lord Bassanio gave his ring awayUnto the judge that begg'd it and indeedDeserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;And neither man nor master would take aughtBut the two rings.PORTIAWhat ring gave you my lord?Not that, I hope, which you received of me.BASSANIOIf I could add a lie unto a fault,I would deny it; but you see my fingerHath not the ring upon it; it is gone.PORTIAEven so void is your false heart of truth.By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bedUntil I see the ring.NERISSANor I in yoursTill I again see mine.BASSANIOSweet Portia,If you did know to whom I gave the ring,If you did know for whom I gave the ringAnd would conceive for what I gave the ringAnd how unwillingly I left the ring,When nought would be accepted but the ring,You would abate the strength of your displeasure.PORTIAIf you had known the virtue of the ring,Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,Or your own honour to contain the ring,You would not then have parted with the ring.What man is there so much unreasonable,If you had pleased to have defended itWith any terms of zeal, wanted the modestyTo urge the thing held as a ceremony?Nerissa teaches me what to believe:I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.BASSANIONo, by my honour, madam, by my soul,No woman had it, but a civil doctor,Which did refuse three thousand ducats of meAnd begg'd the ring; the which I did deny himAnd suffer'd him to go displeased away;Even he that did uphold the very lifeOf my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?I was enforced to send it after him;I was beset with shame and courtesy;My honour would not let ingratitudeSo much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;For, by these blessed candles of the night,Had you been there, I think you would have begg'dThe ring of me to give the worthy doctor.PORTIALet not that doctor e'er come near my house:Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,And that which you did swear to keep for me,I will become as liberal as you;I'll not deny him any thing I have,No, not my body nor my husband's bed:Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:If you do not, if I be left alone,Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.NERISSAAnd I his clerk; therefore be well advisedHow you do leave me to mine own protection.GRATIANOWell, do you so; let not me take him, then;For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.ANTONIOI am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.PORTIASir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.BASSANIOPortia, forgive me this enforced wrong;And, in the hearing of these many friends,I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,Wherein I see myself--PORTIAMark you but that!In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;In each eye, one: swear by your double self,And there's an oath of credit.BASSANIONay, but hear me:Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swearI never more will break an oath with thee.ANTONIOI once did lend my body for his wealth;Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,My soul upon the forfeit, that your lordWill never more break faith advisedly.PORTIAThen you shall be his surety. Give him thisAnd bid him keep it better than the other.ANTONIOHere, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.BASSANIOBy heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!PORTIAI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.NERISSAAnd pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,In lieu of this last night did lie with me.GRATIANOWhy, this is like the mending of highwaysIn summer, where the ways are fair enough:What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?PORTIASpeak not so grossly. You are all amazed:Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;It comes from Padua, from Bellario:There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo hereShall witness I set forth as soon as youAnd even but now return'd; I have not yetEnter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;And I have better news in store for youThan you expect: unseal this letter soon;There you shall find three of your argosiesAre richly come to harbour suddenly:You shall not know by what strange accidentI chanced on this letter.ANTONIOI am dumb.BASSANIOWere you the doctor and I knew you not?GRATIANOWere you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?NERISSAAy, but the clerk that never means to do it,Unless he live until he be a man.BASSANIOSweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:When I am absent, then lie with my wife.ANTONIOSweet lady, you have given me life and living;For here I read for certain that my shipsAre safely come to road.PORTIAHow now, Lorenzo!My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.NERISSAAy, and I'll give them him without a fee.There do I give to you and Jessica,From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.LORENZOFair ladies, you drop manna in the wayOf starved people.PORTIAIt is almost morning,And yet I am sure you are not satisfiedOf these events at full. Let us go in;And charge us there upon inter'gatories,And we will answer all things faithfully.GRATIANOLet it be so: the first inter'gatoryThat my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,Whether till the next night she had rather stay,Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:But were the day come, I should wish it dark,That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.Well, while I live I'll fear no other thingSo sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.ExeuntACT ISCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.Enter two GentlemenFirst GentlemanYou do not meet a man but frowns: our bloodsNo more obey the heavens than our courtiersStill seem as does the king.Second GentlemanBut what's the matter?First GentlemanHis daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whomHe purposed to his wife's sole son--a widowThat late he married--hath referr'd herselfUnto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: allIs outward sorrow; though I think the kingBe touch'd at very heart.Second GentlemanNone but the king?First GentlemanHe that hath lost her too; so is the queen,That most desired the match; but not a courtier,Although they wear their faces to the bentOf the king's look's, hath a heart that is notGlad at the thing they scowl at.Second GentlemanAnd why so?First GentlemanHe that hath miss'd the princess is a thingToo bad for bad report: and he that hath her--I mean, that married her, alack, good man!And therefore banish'd--is a creature suchAs, to seek through the regions of the earthFor one his like, there would be something failingIn him that should compare. I do not thinkSo fair an outward and such stuff withinEndows a man but he.Second GentlemanYou speak him far.First GentlemanI do extend him, sir, within himself,Crush him together rather than unfoldHis measure duly.Second GentlemanWhat's his name and birth?First GentlemanI cannot delve him to the root: his fatherWas call'd Sicilius, who did join his honourAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,But had his titles by Tenantius whomHe served with glory and admired success,So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;And had, besides this gentleman in question,Two other sons, who in the wars o' the timeDied with their swords in hand; for whichtheir father,Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrowThat he quit being, and his gentle lady,Big of this gentleman our theme, deceasedAs he was born. The king he takes the babeTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,Puts to him all the learnings that his timeCould make him the receiver of; which he took,As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,A sample to the youngest, to the more matureA glass that feated them, and to the graverA child that guided dotards; to his mistress,For whom he now is banish'd, her own priceProclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;By her election may be truly readWhat kind of man he is.Second GentlemanI honour himEven out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,Is she sole child to the king?First GentlemanHis only child.He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nurseryWere stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledgeWhich way they went.Second GentlemanHow long is this ago?First GentlemanSome twenty years.Second GentlemanThat a king's children should be so convey'd,So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,That could not trace them!First GentlemanHowsoe'er 'tis strange,Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,Yet is it true, sir.Second GentlemanI do well believe you.First GentlemanWe must forbear: here comes the gentleman,The queen, and princess.ExeuntEnter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGENQUEENNo, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,After the slander of most stepmothers,Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, butYour gaoler shall deliver you the keysThat lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,So soon as I can win the offended king,I will be known your advocate: marry, yetThe fire of rage is in him, and 'twere goodYou lean'd unto his sentence with what patienceYour wisdom may inform you.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSPlease your highness,I will from hence to-day.QUEENYou know the peril.I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pityingThe pangs of barr'd affections, though the kingHath charged you should not speak together.ExitIMOGENODissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrantCan tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--Always reserved my holy duty--whatHis rage can do on me: you must be gone;And I shall here abide the hourly shotOf angry eyes, not comforted to live,But that there is this jewel in the worldThat I may see again.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSMy queen! my mistress!O lady, weep no more, lest I give causeTo be suspected of more tendernessThan doth become a man. I will remainThe loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:My residence in Rome at one Philario's,Who to my father was a friend, to meKnown but by letter: thither write, my queen,And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,Though ink be made of gall.Re-enter QUEENQUEENBe brief, I pray you:If the king come, I shall incur I know notHow much of his displeasure.AsideYet I'll move himTo walk this way: I never do him wrong,But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;Pays dear for my offences.ExitPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSShould we be taking leaveAs long a term as yet we have to live,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!IMOGENNay, stay a little:Were you but riding forth to air yourself,Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;But keep it till you woo another wife,When Imogen is dead.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSHow, how! another?You gentle gods, give me but this I have,And sear up my embracements from a nextWith bonds of death!Putting on the ringRemain, remain thou hereWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,As I my poor self did exchange for you,To your so infinite loss, so in our triflesI still win of you: for my sake wear this;It is a manacle of love; I'll place itUpon this fairest prisoner.Putting a bracelet upon her armIMOGENO the gods!When shall we see again?Enter CYMBELINE and LordsPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSAlack, the king!CYMBELINEThou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!If after this command thou fraught the courtWith thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!Thou'rt poison to my blood.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThe gods protect you!And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.ExitIMOGENThere cannot be a pinch in deathMore sharp than this is.CYMBELINEO disloyal thing,That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'stA year's age on me.IMOGENI beseech you, sir,Harm not yourself with your vexationI am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rareSubdues all pangs, all fears.CYMBELINEPast grace? obedience?IMOGENPast hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.CYMBELINEThat mightst have had the sole son of my queen!IMOGENO blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,And did avoid a puttock.CYMBELINEThou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throneA seat for baseness.IMOGENNo; I rather addedA lustre to it.CYMBELINEO thou vile one!IMOGENSir,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:You bred him as my playfellow, and he isA man worth any woman, overbuys meAlmost the sum he pays.CYMBELINEWhat, art thou mad?IMOGENAlmost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I wereA neat-herd's daughter, and my LeonatusOur neighbour shepherd's son!CYMBELINEThou foolish thing!Re-enter QUEENThey were again together: you have doneNot after our command. Away with her,And pen her up.QUEENBeseech your patience. Peace,Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfortOut of your best advice.CYMBELINENay, let her languishA drop of blood a day; and, being aged,Die of this folly!Exeunt CYMBELINE and LordsQUEENFie! you must give way.Enter PISANIOHere is your servant. How now, sir! What news?PISANIOMy lord your son drew on my master.QUEENHa!No harm, I trust, is done?PISANIOThere might have been,But that my master rather play'd than foughtAnd had no help of anger: they were partedBy gentlemen at hand.QUEENI am very glad on't.IMOGENYour son's my father's friend; he takes his part.To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!I would they were in Afric both together;Myself by with a needle, that I might prickThe goer-back. Why came you from your master?PISANIOOn his command: he would not suffer meTo bring him to the haven; left these notesOf what commands I should be subject to,When 't pleased you to employ me.QUEENThis hath beenYour faithful servant: I dare lay mine honourHe will remain so.PISANIOI humbly thank your highness.QUEENPray, walk awhile.IMOGENAbout some half-hour hence,I pray you, speak with me: you shall at leastGo see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.ExeuntSCENE II.

Have I hurt him?Second Lord[Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.First LordHurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he benot hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.Second Lord[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' thebackside the town.CLOTENThe villain would not stand me.Second Lord[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.First LordStand you! You have land enough of your own: buthe added to your having; gave you some ground.Second Lord[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.

Would there had been somehurt done!Second Lord[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fallof an ass, which is no great hurt.CLOTENYou'll go with us?First LordI'll attend your lordship.CLOTENNay, come, let's go together.Second LordWell, my lord.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.Enter IMOGEN and PISANIOIMOGENI would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,And question'dst every sail: if he should writeAnd not have it, 'twere a paper lost,As offer'd mercy is. What was the lastThat he spake to thee?PISANIOIt was his queen, his queen!IMOGENThen waved his handkerchief?PISANIOAnd kiss'd it, madam.IMOGENSenseless Linen! happier therein than I!And that was all?PISANIONo, madam; for so longAs he could make me with this eye or earDistinguish him from others, he did keepThe deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mindCould best express how slow his soul sail'd on,How swift his ship.IMOGENThou shouldst have made himAs little as a crow, or less, ere leftTo after-eye him.PISANIOMadam, so I did.IMOGENI would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, butTo look upon him, till the diminutionOf space had pointed him sharp as my needle,Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted fromThe smallness of a gnat to air, and thenHave turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,When shall we hear from him?PISANIOBe assured, madam,With his next vantage.IMOGENI did not take my leave of him, but hadMost pretty things to say: ere I could tell himHow I would think on him at certain hoursSuch thoughts and such, or I could make him swearThe shes of Italy should not betrayMine interest and his honour, or have charged him,At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,To encounter me with orisons, for thenI am in heaven for him; or ere I couldGive him that parting kiss which I had setBetwixt two charming words, comes in my fatherAnd like the tyrannous breathing of the northShakes all our buds from growing.Enter a LadyLadyThe queen, madam,Desires your highness' company.IMOGENThose things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.I will attend the queen.PISANIOMadam, I shall.ExeuntSCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a SpaniardIACHIMOBelieve it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he wasthen of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthyas since he hath been allowed the name of; but Icould then have looked on him without the help ofadmiration, though the catalogue of his endowmentshad been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.PHILARIOYou speak of him when he was less furnished than nowhe is with that which makes him both without and within.FrenchmanI have seen him in France: we had very many therecould behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.IACHIMOThis matter of marrying his king's daughter, whereinhe must be weighed rather by her value than his own,words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.FrenchmanAnd then his banishment.IACHIMOAy, and the approbation of those that weep thislamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfullyto extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,which else an easy battery might lay flat, fortaking a beggar without less quality. But how comesit he is to sojourn with you? How creepsacquaintance?PHILARIOHis father and I were soldiers together; to whom Ihave been often bound for no less than my life.Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertainedamongst you as suits, with gentlemen of yourknowing, to a stranger of his quality.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI beseech you all, be better known to thisgentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friendof mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appearhereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.FrenchmanSir, we have known together in Orleans.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.FrenchmanSir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad Idid atone my countryman and you; it had been pityyou should have been put together with so mortal apurpose as then each bore, upon importance of soslight and trivial a nature.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSBy your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;rather shunned to go even with what I heard than inmy every action to be guided by others' experiences:but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to sayit is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.Frenchman'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,and by such two that would by all likelihood haveconfounded one the other, or have fallen both.IACHIMOCan we, with manners, ask what was the difference?FrenchmanSafely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.It was much like an argument that fell out lastnight, where each of us fell in praise of ourcountry mistresses; this gentleman at that timevouching--and upon warrant of bloodyaffirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptablethan any the rarest of our ladies in France.IACHIMOThat lady is not now living, or this gentleman'sopinion by this worn out.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSShe holds her virtue still and I my mind.IACHIMOYou must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSBeing so far provoked as I was in France, I wouldabate her nothing, though I profess myself heradorer, not her friend.IACHIMOAs fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-handcomparison--had been something too fair and too goodfor any lady in Britain. If she went before othersI have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustresmany I have beheld. I could not but believe sheexcelled many: but I have not seen the mostprecious diamond that is, nor you the lady.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.IACHIMOWhat do you esteem it at?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSMore than the world enjoys.IACHIMOEither your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she'soutprized by a trifle.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYou are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, ifthere were wealth enough for the purchase, or meritfor the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,and only the gift of the gods.IACHIMOWhich the gods have given you?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWhich, by their graces, I will keep.IACHIMOYou may wear her in title yours: but, you know,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Yourring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizableestimations; the one is but frail and the othercasual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplishedcourtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYour Italy contains none so accomplished a courtierto convince the honour of my mistress, if, in theholding or loss of that, you term her frail. I donothing doubt you have store of thieves;notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.PHILARIOLet us leave here, gentlemen.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, Ithank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.IACHIMOWith five times so much conversation, I should getground of your fair mistress, make her go back, evento the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNo, no.IACHIMOI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate toyour ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues itsomething: but I make my wager rather against yourconfidence than her reputation: and, to bar youroffence herein too, I durst attempt it against anylady in the world.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYou are a great deal abused in too bold apersuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you'reworthy of by your attempt.IACHIMOWhat's that?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSA repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,deserve more; a punishment too.PHILARIOGentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, bebetter acquainted.IACHIMOWould I had put my estate and my neighbour's on theapprobation of what I have spoke!POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWhat lady would you choose to assail?IACHIMOYours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,that, commend me to the court where your lady is,with no more advantage than the opportunity of asecond conference, and I will bring from thencethat honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ringI hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.IACHIMOYou are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buyladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannotpreserve it from tainting: but I see you have somereligion in you, that you fear.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThis is but a custom in your tongue; you bear agraver purpose, I hope.IACHIMOI am the master of my speeches, and would undergowhat's spoken, I swear.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWill you? I shall but lend my diamond till yourreturn: let there be covenants drawn between's: mymistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of yourunworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.PHILARIOI will have it no lay.IACHIMOBy the gods, it is one. If I bring you nosufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearestbodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducatsare yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold areyours: provided I have your commendation for my morefree entertainment.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI embrace these conditions; let us have articlesbetwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: ifyou make your voyage upon her and give me directlyto understand you have prevailed, I am no furtheryour enemy; she is not worth our debate: if sheremain unseduced, you not making it appearotherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault youhave made to her chastity you shall answer me withyour sword.IACHIMOYour hand; a covenant: we will have these things setdown by lawful counsel, and straight away forBritain, lest the bargain should catch cold andstarve: I will fetch my gold and have our twowagers recorded.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSAgreed.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMOFrenchmanWill this hold, think you?PHILARIOSignior Iachimo will not from it.Pray, let us follow 'em.ExeuntSCENE V.

Have I not beenThy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me howTo make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, soThat our great king himself doth woo me oftFor my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meetThat I did amplify my judgment inOther conclusions? I will try the forcesOf these thy compounds on such creatures asWe count not worth the hanging, but none human,To try the vigour of them and applyAllayments to their act, and by them gatherTheir several virtues and effects.CORNELIUSYour highnessShall from this practise but make hard your heart:Besides, the seeing these effects will beBoth noisome and infectious.QUEENO, content thee.Enter PISANIOAsideHere comes a flattering rascal; upon himWill I first work: he's for his master,An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!Doctor, your service for this time is ended;Take your own way.CORNELIUS[Aside] I do suspect you, madam;But you shall do no harm.QUEEN[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.CORNELIUS[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she hasStrange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,And will not trust one of her malice withA drug of such damn'd nature. Those she hasWill stupefy and dull the sense awhile;Which first, perchance, she'll prove oncats and dogs,Then afterward up higher: but there isNo danger in what show of death it makes,More than the locking-up the spirits a time,To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'dWith a most false effect; and I the truer,So to be false with her.QUEENNo further service, doctor,Until I send for thee.CORNELIUSI humbly take my leave.ExitQUEENWeeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in timeShe will not quench and let instructions enterWhere folly now possesses? Do thou work:When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,I'll tell thee on the instant thou art thenAs great as is thy master, greater, forHis fortunes all lie speechless and his nameIs at last gasp: return he cannot, norContinue where he is: to shift his beingIs to exchange one misery with another,And every day that comes comes to decayA day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,To be depender on a thing that leans,Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,So much as but to prop him?The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it upThou takest upThou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:It is a thing I made, which hath the kingFive times redeem'd from death: I do not knowWhat is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;It is an earnest of a further goodThat I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress howThe case stands with her; do't as from thyself.Think what a chance thou changest on, but thinkThou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the kingTo any shape of thy preferment suchAs thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,That set thee on to this desert, am boundTo load thy merit richly. Call my women:Think on my words.Exit PISANIOA sly and constant knave,Not to be shaked; the agent for his masterAnd the remembrancer of her to holdThe hand-fast to her lord. I have given him thatWhich, if he take, shall quite unpeople herOf liegers for her sweet, and which she after,Except she bend her humour, shall be assuredTo taste of too.Re-enter PISANIO and LadiesSo, so: well done, well done:The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;Think on my words.Exeunt QUEEN and LadiesPISANIOAnd shall do:But when to my good lord I prove untrue,I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.ExitSCENE VI. The same.

A kind of conquestCaesar made here; but made not here his bragOf 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--That first that ever touch'd him--he was carriedFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'dAs easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereofThe famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires brightAnd Britons strut with courage.CLOTENCome, there's no more tribute to be paid: ourkingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other ofthem may have crook'd noses, but to owe suchstraight arms, none.CYMBELINESon, let your mother end.CLOTENWe have yet many among us can gripe as hard asCassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have ahand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? IfCaesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, orput the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tributefor light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.CYMBELINEYou must know,Till the injurious Romans did extortThis tribute from us, we were free:Caesar's ambition,Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretchThe sides o' the world, against all colour hereDid put the yoke upon 's; which to shake offBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckonOurselves to be.CLOTEN LordsWe do.CYMBELINESay, then, to Caesar,Our ancestor was that Mulmutius whichOrdain'd our laws, whose use the sword of CaesarHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchiseShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,Who was the first of Britain which did putHis brows within a golden crown and call'dHimself a king.CAIUS LUCIUSI am sorry, Cymbeline,That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--Caesar, that hath more kings his servants thanThyself domestic officers--thine enemy:Receive it from me, then: war and confusionIn Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: lookFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,I thank thee for myself.CYMBELINEThou art welcome, Caius.Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spentMuch under him; of him I gather'd honour;Which he to seek of me again, perforce,Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfectThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians forTheir liberties are now in arms; a precedentWhich not to read would show the Britons cold:So Caesar shall not find them.CAIUS LUCIUSLet proof speak.CLOTENHis majesty bids you welcome. Makepastime with us a day or two, or longer: ifyou seek us afterwards in other terms, youshall find us in our salt-water girdle: if youbeat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall inthe adventure, our crows shall fare the betterfor you; and there's an end.CAIUS LUCIUSSo, sir.CYMBELINEI know your master's pleasure and he mine:All the remain is 'Welcome!'ExeuntSCENE II. Another room in the palace.Enter PISANIO, with a letterPISANIOHow? of adultery? Wherefore write you notWhat monster's her accuser? Leonatus,O master! what a strange infectionIs fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'dOn thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaultsAs would take in some virtue. O my master!Thy mind to her is now as low as wereThy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?Upon the love and truth and vows which IHave made to thy command? I, her? her blood?If it be so to do good service, neverLet me be counted serviceable. How look I,That I should seem to lack humanityso much as this fact comes to?Reading'Do't: the letterthat I have sent her, by her own commandShall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'stSo virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.I am ignorant in what I am commanded.Enter IMOGENIMOGENHow now, Pisanio!PISANIOMadam, here is a letter from my lord.IMOGENWho? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!O, learn'd indeed were that astronomerThat knew the stars as I his characters;He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,Let what is here contain'd relish of love,Of my lord's health, of his content, yet notThat we two are asunder; let that grieve him:Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,For it doth physic love: of his content,All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest beYou bees that make these locks of counsel! LoversAnd men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yetYou clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!Reads'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take mein his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, asyou, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew mewith your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out ofthis advise you, follow. So he wishes you allhappiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,increasing in love,LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell meHow far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairsMay plod it in a week, why may not IGlide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,To the smothering of the sense--how far it isTo this same blessed Milford: and by the wayTell me how Wales was made so happy asTo inherit such a haven: but first of all,How we may steal from hence, and for the gapThat we shall make in time, from our hence-goingAnd our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,How many score of miles may we well ride'Twixt hour and hour?PISANIOOne score 'twixt sun and sun,Madam, 's enough for you:Asideand too much too.IMOGENWhy, one that rode to's execution, man,Could never go so slow: I have heard ofriding wagers,Where horses have been nimbler than the sandsThat run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:Go bid my woman feign a sickness; sayShe'll home to her father: and provide me presentlyA riding-suit, no costlier than would fitA franklin's housewife.PISANIOMadam, you're best consider.IMOGENI see before me, man: nor here, nor here,Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,Accessible is none but Milford way.ExeuntSCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS followingBELARIUSA goodly day not to keep house, with suchWhose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gateInstructs you how to adore the heavens and bows youTo a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchsAre arch'd so high that giants may jet throughAnd keep their impious turbans on, withoutGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardlyAs prouder livers do.GUIDERIUSHail, heaven!ARVIRAGUSHail, heaven!BELARIUSNow for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,When you above perceive me like a crow,That it is place which lessens and sets off;And you may then revolve what tales I have told youOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:This service is not service, so being done,But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,Draws us a profit from all things we see;And often, to our comfort, shall we findThe sharded beetle in a safer holdThan is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this lifeIs nobler than attending for a cheque,Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.GUIDERIUSOut of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know notWhat air's from home. Haply this life is best,If quiet life be best; sweeter to youThat have a sharper known; well correspondingWith your stiff age: but unto us it isA cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;A prison for a debtor, that not daresTo stride a limit.ARVIRAGUSWhat should we speak ofWhen we are old as you? when we shall hearThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,In this our pinching cave, shall we discourseThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;Our valour is to chase what flies; our cageWe make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,And sing our bondage freely.BELARIUSHow you speak!Did you but know the city's usuriesAnd felt them knowingly; the art o' the courtAs hard to leave as keep; whose top to climbIs certain falling, or so slippery thatThe fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,A pain that only seems to seek out dangerI' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'the search,And hath as oft a slanderous epitaphAs record of fair act; nay, many times,Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this storyThe world may read in me: my body's mark'dWith Roman swords, and my report was onceFirst with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,And when a soldier was the theme, my nameWas not far off: then was I as a treeWhose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,A storm or robbery, call it what you will,Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,And left me bare to weather.GUIDERIUSUncertain favour!BELARIUSMy fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'dBefore my perfect honour, swore to CymbelineI was confederate with the Romans: soFollow'd my banishment, and this twenty yearsThis rock and these demesnes have been my world;Where I have lived at honest freedom, paidMore pious debts to heaven than in allThe fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!This is not hunters' language: he that strikesThe venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;To him the other two shall minister;And we will fear no poison, which attendsIn place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUSHow hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!These boys know little they are sons to the king;Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.They think they are mine; and though train'dup thus meanlyI' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hitThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts themIn simple and low things to prince it muchBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, whoThe king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!When on my three-foot stool I sit and tellThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly outInto my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even thenThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in postureThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,Strikes life into my speech and shows much moreHis own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knowsThou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,At three and two years old, I stole these babes;Thinking to bar thee of succession, asThou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,Thou wast their nurse; they took thee fortheir mother,And every day do honour to her grave:Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,They take for natural father. The game is up.ExitSCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.Enter PISANIO and IMOGENIMOGENThou told'st me, when we came from horse, the placeWas near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother soTo see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sighFrom the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,Would be interpreted a thing perplex'dBeyond self-explication: put thyselfInto a havior of less fear, ere wildnessVanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?Why tender'st thou that paper to me, withA look untender? If't be summer news,Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'stBut keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongueMay take off some extremity, which to readWould be even mortal to me.PISANIOPlease you, read;And you shall find me, wretched man, a thingThe most disdain'd of fortune.IMOGEN[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played thestrumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof liebleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,but from proof as strong as my grief and as certainas I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted withthe breach of hers. Let thine own hands take awayher life: I shall give thee opportunity atMilford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purposewhere, if thou fear to strike and to make me certainit is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour andequally to me disloyal.'PISANIOWhat shall I need to draw my sword? the paperHath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongueOutvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breathRides on the posting winds and doth belieAll corners of the world: kings, queens and states,Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the graveThis viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?IMOGENFalse to his bed! What is it to be false?To lie in watch there and to think on him?To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleepcharge nature,To break it with a fearful dream of himAnd cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?PISANIOAlas, good lady!IMOGENI false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinksThy favour's good enough. Some jay of ItalyWhose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thoughtPut on for villany; not born where't grows,But worn a bait for ladies.PISANIOGood madam, hear me.IMOGENTrue honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weepingDid scandal many a holy tear, took pityFrom most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjuredFrom thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,A little witness my obedience: look!I draw the sword myself: take it, and hitThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart;Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;Thy master is not there, who was indeedThe riches of it: do his bidding; strikeThou mayst be valiant in a better cause;But now thou seem'st a coward.PISANIOHence, vile instrument!Thou shalt not damn my hand.IMOGENWhy, I must die;And if I do not by thy hand, thou artNo servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughterThere is a prohibition so divineThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,Corrupters of my faith! you shall no moreBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor foolsBelieve false teachers: though those thatare betray'dDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitorStands in worse case of woe.And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set upMy disobedience 'gainst the king my fatherAnd make me put into contempt the suitsOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter findIt is no act of common passage, butA strain of rareness: and I grieve myselfTo think, when thou shalt be disedged by herThat now thou tirest on, how thy memoryWill then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,When I desire it too.PISANIOO gracious lady,Since I received command to do this businessI have not slept one wink.IMOGENDo't, and to bed then.PISANIOI'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.IMOGENWherefore thenDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abusedSo many miles with a pretence? this place?Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,For my being absent? whereunto I neverPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,The elected deer before thee?PISANIOBut to win timeTo lose so bad employment; in the whichI have consider'd of a course. Good lady,Hear me with patience.IMOGENTalk thy tongue weary; speakI have heard I am a strumpet; and mine earTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.PISANIOThen, madam,I thought you would not back again.IMOGENMost like;Bringing me here to kill me.PISANIONot so, neither:But if I were as wise as honest, thenMy purpose would prove well. It cannot beBut that my master is abused:Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.Hath done you both this cursed injury.IMOGENSome Roman courtezan.PISANIONo, on my life.I'll give but notice you are dead and send himSome bloody sign of it; for 'tis commandedI should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,And that will well confirm it.IMOGENWhy good fellow,What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?Or in my life what comfort, when I amDead to my husband?PISANIOIf you'll back to the court--IMOGENNo court, no father; nor no more adoWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to meAs fearful as a siege.PISANIOIf not at court,Then not in Britain must you bide.IMOGENWhere thenHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volumeOur Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, thinkThere's livers out of Britain.PISANIOI am most gladYou think of other place. The ambassador,Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-HavenTo-morrow: now, if you could wear a mindDark as your fortune is, and but disguiseThat which, to appear itself, must not yet beBut by self-danger, you should tread a coursePretty and full of view; yea, haply, nearThe residence of Posthumus; so nigh at leastThat though his actions were not visible, yetReport should render him hourly to your earAs truly as he moves.IMOGENO, for such means!Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,I would adventure.PISANIOWell, then, here's the point:You must forget to be a woman; changeCommand into obedience: fear and niceness--The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy andAs quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you mustForget that rarest treasure of your cheek,Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touchOf common-kissing Titan, and forgetYour laboursome and dainty trims, whereinYou made great Juno angry.IMOGENNay, be briefI see into thy end, and am almostA man already.PISANIOFirst, make yourself but like one.Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, allThat answer to them: would you in their serving,And with what imitation you can borrowFrom youth of such a season, 'fore noble LuciusPresent yourself, desire his service, tell himwherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,If that his head have ear in music,--doubtlessWith joy he will embrace you, for he's honourableAnd doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,You have me, rich; and I will never failBeginning nor supplyment.IMOGENThou art all the comfortThe gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:There's more to be consider'd; but we'll evenAll that good time will give us: this attemptI am soldier to, and will abide it withA prince's courage. Away, I prithee.PISANIOWell, madam, we must take a short farewell,Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected ofYour carriage from the court. My noble mistress,Here is a box; I had it from the queen:What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of thisWill drive away distemper. To some shade,And fit you to your manhood. May the godsDirect you to the best!IMOGENAmen: I thank thee.Exeunt, severallySCENE V.

Happiness!Exeunt LUCIUS and LordsQUEENHe goes hence frowning: but it honours usThat we have given him cause.CLOTEN'Tis all the better;Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.CYMBELINELucius hath wrote already to the emperorHow it goes here. It fits us therefore ripelyOur chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:The powers that he already hath in GalliaWill soon be drawn to head, from whence he movesHis war for Britain.QUEEN'Tis not sleepy business;But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.CYMBELINEOur expectation that it would be thusHath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'dBefore the Roman, nor to us hath tender'dThe duty of the day: she looks us likeA thing more made of malice than of duty:We have noted it. Call her before us; forWe have been too slight in sufferance.Exit an AttendantQUEENRoyal sir,Since the exile of Posthumus, most retiredHath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a ladySo tender of rebukes that words are strokesAnd strokes death to her.Re-enter AttendantCYMBELINEWhere is she, sir? HowCan her contempt be answer'd?AttendantPlease you, sir,Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answerThat will be given to the loudest noise we make.QUEENMy lord, when last I went to visit her,She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,She should that duty leave unpaid to you,Which daily she was bound to proffer: thisShe wish'd me to make known; but our great courtMade me to blame in memory.CYMBELINEHer doors lock'd?Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fearProve false!ExitQUEENSon, I say, follow the king.CLOTENThat man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,have not seen these two days.QUEENGo, look after.Exit CLOTENPisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absenceProceed by swallowing that, for he believesIt is a thing most precious. But for her,Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flownTo her desired Posthumus: gone she isTo death or to dishonour; and my endCan make good use of either: she being down,I have the placing of the British crown.Re-enter CLOTENHow now, my son!CLOTEN'Tis certain she is fled.Go in and cheer the king: he rages; noneDare come about him.QUEEN[Aside] All the better: mayThis night forestall him of the coming day!ExitCLOTENI love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisiteThan lady, ladies, woman; from every oneThe best she hath, and she, of all compounded,Outsells them all; I love her therefore: butDisdaining me and throwing favours onThe low Posthumus slanders so her judgmentThat what's else rare is choked; and in that pointI will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--Enter PISANIOWho is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,Where is thy lady? In a word; or elseThou art straightway with the fiends.PISANIOO, good my lord!CLOTENWhere is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--I will not ask again. Close villain,I'll have this secret from thy heart, or ripThy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?From whose so many weights of baseness cannotA dram of worth be drawn.PISANIOAlas, my lord,How can she be with him? When was she missed?He is in Rome.CLOTENWhere is she, sir? Come nearer;No further halting: satisfy me homeWhat is become of her.PISANIOO, my all-worthy lord!CLOTENAll-worthy villain!Discover where thy mistress is at once,At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'Speak, or thy silence on the instant isThy condemnation and thy death.PISANIOThen, sir,This paper is the history of my knowledgeTouching her flight.Presenting a letterCLOTENLet's see't. I will pursue herEven to Augustus' throne.PISANIO[Aside] Or this, or perish.She's far enough; and what he learns by thisMay prove his travel, not her danger.CLOTENHum!PISANIO[Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!CLOTENSirrah, is this letter true?PISANIOSir, as I think.CLOTENIt is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thouwouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,undergo those employments wherein I should havecause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform itdirectly and truly, I would think thee an honestman: thou shouldst neither want my means for thyrelief nor my voice for thy preferment.PISANIOWell, my good lord.CLOTENWilt thou serve me? for since patiently andconstantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune ofthat beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in thecourse of gratitude, but be a diligent follower ofmine: wilt thou serve me?PISANIOSir, I will.CLOTENGive me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thylate master's garments in thy possession?PISANIOI have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit hewore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.CLOTENThe first service thou dost me, fetch that suithither: let it be thy lint service; go.PISANIOI shall, my lord.ExitCLOTENMeet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him onething; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thouvillain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would thesegarments were come. She said upon a time--thebitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that sheheld the very garment of Posthumus in more respectthan my noble and natural person together with theadornment of my qualities. With that suit upon myback, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in hereyes; there shall she see my valour, which will thenbe a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, myspeech of insultment ended on his dead body, andwhen my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vexher I will execute in the clothes that she sopraised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foother home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,and I'll be merry in my revenge.Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothesBe those the garments?PISANIOAy, my noble lord.CLOTENHow long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?PISANIOShe can scarce be there yet.CLOTENBring this apparel to my chamber; that is the secondthing that I have commanded thee: the third is,that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Bebut duteous, and true preferment shall tender itselfto thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I hadwings to follow it! Come, and be true.ExitPISANIOThou bid'st me to my loss: for true to theeWere to prove false, which I will never be,To him that is most true. To Milford go,And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speedBe cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!ExitSCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothesIMOGENI see a man's life is a tedious one:I have tired myself, and for two nights togetherHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick,But that my resolution helps me. Milford,When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I thinkFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told meI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tisA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulnessIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehoodIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,My hunger's gone; but even before, I wasAt point to sink for food. But what is this?Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:I were best not to call; I dare not call:yet famine,Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness everOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,Take or lend. Ho! No answer?

Why should his mistress, who was made byhim that made the tailor, not be fit too? therather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis saida woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I mustplay the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for itis not vain-glory for a man and his glass to conferin his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body areas well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in theadvantage of the time, above him in birth, alikeconversant in general services, and more remarkablein single oppositions: yet this imperceiverantthing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thyshoulders, shall within this hour be off; thymistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces beforethy face: and all this done, spurn her home to herfather; who may haply be a little angry for my sorough usage; but my mother, having power of histestiness, shall turn all into my commendations.

I am very sick.GUIDERIUSGo you to hunting; I'll abide with him.IMOGENSo sick I am not, yet I am not well;But not so citizen a wanton asTo seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;Stick to your journal course: the breach of customIs breach of all. I am ill, but your being by meCannot amend me; society is no comfortTo one not sociable: I am not very sick,Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,Stealing so poorly.GUIDERIUSI love thee; I have spoke itHow much the quantity, the weight as much,As I do love my father.BELARIUSWhat! how! how!ARVIRAGUSIf it be sin to say so, I yoke meIn my good brother's fault: I know not whyI love this youth; and I have heard you say,Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say'My father, not this youth.'BELARIUS[Aside] O noble strain!O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.I'm not their father; yet who this should be,Doth miracle itself, loved before me.'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.ARVIRAGUSBrother, farewell.IMOGENI wish ye sport.ARVIRAGUSYou health. So please you, sir.IMOGEN[Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what liesI have heard!Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:Experience, O, thou disprovest report!The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dishPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,I'll now taste of thy drug.Swallows someGUIDERIUSI could not stir him:He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.ARVIRAGUSThus did he answer me: yet said, hereafterI might know more.BELARIUSTo the field, to the field!We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.ARVIRAGUSWe'll not be long away.BELARIUSPray, be not sick,For you must be our housewife.IMOGENWell or ill,I am bound to you.BELARIUSAnd shalt be ever.Exit IMOGEN, to the caveThis youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath hadGood ancestors.ARVIRAGUSHow angel-like he sings!GUIDERIUSBut his neat cookery! he cut our rootsIn characters,And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sickAnd he her dieter.ARVIRAGUSNobly he yokesA smiling with a sigh, as if the sighWas that it was, for not being such a smile;The smile mocking the sigh, that it would flyFrom so divine a temple, to commixWith winds that sailors rail at.GUIDERIUSI do noteThat grief and patience, rooted in him both,Mingle their spurs together.ARVIRAGUSGrow, patience!And let the stinking elder, grief, untwineHis perishing root with the increasing vine!BELARIUSIt is great morning. Come, away!--Who's there?Enter CLOTENCLOTENI cannot find those runagates; that villainHath mock'd me. I am faint.BELARIUS'Those runagates!'Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tisCloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.I saw him not these many years, and yetI know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!GUIDERIUSHe is but one: you and my brother searchWhat companies are near: pray you, away;Let me alone with him.Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUSCLOTENSoft! What are youThat fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?I have heard of such. What slave art thou?GUIDERIUSA thingMore slavish did I ne'er than answeringA slave without a knock.CLOTENThou art a robber,A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.GUIDERIUSTo who? to thee? What art thou? Have not IAn arm as big as thine? a heart as big?Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear notMy dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,Why I should yield to thee?CLOTENThou villain base,Know'st me not by my clothes?GUIDERIUSNo, nor thy tailor, rascal,Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,Which, as it seems, make thee.CLOTENThou precious varlet,My tailor made them not.GUIDERIUSHence, then, and thankThe man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;I am loath to beat thee.CLOTENThou injurious thief,Hear but my name, and tremble.GUIDERIUSWhat's thy name?CLOTENCloten, thou villain.GUIDERIUSCloten, thou double villain, be thy name,I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, orAdder, Spider,'Twould move me sooner.CLOTENTo thy further fear,Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt knowI am son to the queen.GUIDERIUSI am sorry for 't; not seemingSo worthy as thy birth.CLOTENArt not afeard?GUIDERIUSThose that I reverence those I fear, the wise:At fools I laugh, not fear them.CLOTENDie the death:When I have slain thee with my proper hand,I'll follow those that even now fled hence,And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:Yield, rustic mountaineer.Exeunt, fightingRe-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUSBELARIUSNo companies abroad?ARVIRAGUSNone in the world: you did mistake him, sure.BELARIUSI cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favourWhich then he wore; the snatches in his voice,And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute'Twas very Cloten.ARVIRAGUSIn this place we left them:I wish my brother make good time with him,You say he is so fell.BELARIUSBeing scarce made up,I mean, to man, he had not apprehensionOf roaring terrors; for the effect of judgmentIs oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S headGUIDERIUSThis Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;There was no money in't: not HerculesCould have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:Yet I not doing this, the fool had borneMy head as I do his.BELARIUSWhat hast thou done?GUIDERIUSI am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,Son to the queen, after his own report;Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and sworeWith his own single hand he'ld take us inDisplace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,And set them on Lud's-town.BELARIUSWe are all undone.GUIDERIUSWhy, worthy father, what have we to lose,But that he swore to take, our lives? The lawProtects not us: then why should we be tenderTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,Play judge and executioner all himself,For we do fear the law? What companyDiscover you abroad?BELARIUSNo single soulCan we set eye on; but in all safe reasonHe must have some attendants. Though his humourWas nothing but mutation, ay, and thatFrom one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, notAbsolute madness could so far have ravedTo bring him here alone; although perhapsIt may be heard at court that such as weCave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in timeMay make some stronger head; the which he hearing--As it is like him--might break out, and swearHe'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probableTo come alone, either he so undertaking,Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,If we do fear this body hath a tailMore perilous than the head.ARVIRAGUSLet ordinanceCome as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,My brother hath done well.BELARIUSI had no mindTo hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sicknessDid make my way long forth.GUIDERIUSWith his own sword,Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'enHis head from him: I'll throw't into the creekBehind our rock; and let it to the sea,And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:That's all I reck.ExitBELARIUSI fear 'twill be revenged:Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valourBecomes thee well enough.ARVIRAGUSWould I had done'tSo the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,I love thee brotherly, but envy muchThou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,That possible strength might meet, would seek us throughAnd put us to our answer.BELARIUSWell, 'tis done:We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for dangerWhere there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stayTill hasty Polydote return, and bring himTo dinner presently.ARVIRAGUSPoor sick Fidele!I'll weringly to him: to gain his colourI'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,And praise myself for charity.ExitBELARIUSO thou goddess,Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'stIn these two princely boys! They are as gentleAs zephyrs blowing below the violet,Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,That by the top doth take the mountain pine,And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonderThat an invisible instinct should frame themTo royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,Civility not seen from other, valourThat wildly grows in them, but yields a cropAs if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strangeWhat Cloten's being here to us portends,Or what his death will bring us.Re-enter GUIDERIUSGUIDERIUSWhere's my brother?I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,In embassy to his mother: his body's hostageFor his return.Solemn musicBELARIUSMy ingenious instrument!Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasionHath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!GUIDERIUSIs he at home?BELARIUSHe went hence even now.GUIDERIUSWhat does he mean? since death of my dear'st motherit did not speak before. All solemn thingsShould answer solemn accidents. The matter?Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toysIs jollity for apes and grief for boys.Is Cadwal mad?BELARIUSLook, here he comes,And brings the dire occasion in his armsOf what we blame him for.Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his armsARVIRAGUSThe bird is deadThat we have made so much on. I had ratherHave skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,Than have seen this.GUIDERIUSO sweetest, fairest lily!My brother wears thee not the one half so wellAs when thou grew'st thyself.BELARIUSO melancholy!Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? findThe ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crareMight easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.How found you him?ARVIRAGUSStark, as you see:Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; hisright cheekReposing on a cushion.GUIDERIUSWhere?ARVIRAGUSO' the floor;His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and putMy clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudenessAnswer'd my steps too loud.GUIDERIUSWhy, he but sleeps:If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,And worms will not come to thee.ARVIRAGUSWith fairest flowersWhilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lackThe flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, norThe azured harebell, like thy veins, no, norThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shamingThose rich-left heirs that let their fathers lieWithout a monument!--bring thee all this;Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,To winter-ground thy corse.GUIDERIUSPrithee, have done;And do not play in wench-like words with thatWhich is so serious. Let us bury him,And not protract with admiration whatIs now due debt. To the grave!ARVIRAGUSSay, where shall's lay him?GUIDERIUSBy good Euriphile, our mother.ARVIRAGUSBe't so:And let us, Polydore, though now our voicesHave got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,As once our mother; use like note and words,Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.GUIDERIUSCadwal,I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;For notes of sorrow out of tune are worseThan priests and fanes that lie.ARVIRAGUSWe'll speak it, then.BELARIUSGreat griefs, I see, medicine the less; for ClotenIs quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;And though he came our enemy, rememberHe was paid for that: though mean andmighty, rottingTogether, have one dust, yet reverence,That angel of the world, doth make distinctionOf place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princelyAnd though you took his life, as being our foe,Yet bury him as a prince.GUIDERIUSPray You, fetch him hither.Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',When neither are alive.ARVIRAGUSIf you'll go fetch him,We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.Exit BELARIUSGUIDERIUSNay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;My father hath a reason for't.ARVIRAGUS'Tis true.GUIDERIUSCome on then, and remove him.ARVIRAGUSSo. Begin.SONGGUIDERIUSFear no more the heat o' the sun,Nor the furious winter's rages;Thou thy worldly task hast done,Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:Golden lads and girls all must,As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.ARVIRAGUSFear no more the frown o' the great;Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;Care no more to clothe and eat;To thee the reed is as the oak:The sceptre, learning, physic, mustAll follow this, and come to dust.GUIDERIUSFear no more the lightning flash,ARVIRAGUSNor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;GUIDERIUSFear not slander, censure rash;ARVIRAGUSThou hast finish'd joy and moan:GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUSAll lovers young, all lovers mustConsign to thee, and come to dust.GUIDERIUSNo exorciser harm thee!ARVIRAGUSNor no witchcraft charm thee!GUIDERIUSGhost unlaid forbear thee!ARVIRAGUSNothing ill come near thee!GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUSQuiet consummation have;And renowned be thy grave!Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTENGUIDERIUSWe have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.BELARIUSHere's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the nightAre strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.You were as flowers, now wither'd: even soThese herblets shall, which we upon you strew.Come on, away: apart upon our knees.The ground that gave them first has them again:Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSIMOGEN[Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which isthe way?--I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!Seeing the body of CLOTENThese flowers are like the pleasures of the world;This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyesAre sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,I tremble stiff with fear: but if there beYet left in heaven as small a drop of pityAs a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!The dream's here still: even when I wake, it isWithout me, as within me; not imagined, felt.A headless man!

Pisanio,All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,Hast here cut off my lord. To write and readBe henceforth treacherous! Damn'd PisanioHath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--From this most bravest vessel of the worldStruck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!where's that?Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in themHave laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!The drug he gave me, which he said was preciousAnd cordial to me, have I not found itMurderous to the senses? That confirms it home:This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,That we the horrider may seem to thoseWhich chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!Falls on the bodyEnter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers, and a SoothsayerCaptainTo them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,After your will, have cross'd the sea, attendingYou here at Milford-Haven with your ships:They are in readiness.CAIUS LUCIUSBut what from Rome?CaptainThe senate hath stirr'd up the confinersAnd gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,That promise noble service: and they comeUnder the conduct of bold Iachimo,Syenna's brother.CAIUS LUCIUSWhen expect you them?CaptainWith the next benefit o' the wind.CAIUS LUCIUSThis forwardnessMakes our hopes fair.

Now, sir,What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?SoothsayerLast night the very gods show'd me a vision--I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'dFrom the spongy south to this part of the west,There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--Unless my sins abuse my divination--Success to the Roman host.CAIUS LUCIUSDream often so,And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is hereWithout his top? The ruin speaks that sometimeIt was a worthy building. How! a page!Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;For nature doth abhor to make his bedWith the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.Let's see the boy's face.CaptainHe's alive, my lord.CAIUS LUCIUSHe'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seemsThey crave to be demanded. Who is thisThou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was heThat, otherwise than noble nature did,Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interestIn this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?What art thou?IMOGENI am nothing: or if not,Nothing to be were better. This was my master,A very valiant Briton and a good,That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!There is no more such masters: I may wanderFrom east to occident, cry out for service,Try many, all good, serve truly, neverFind such another master.CAIUS LUCIUS'Lack, good youth!Thou movest no less with thy complaining thanThy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.IMOGENRichard du Champ.AsideIf I do lie and doNo harm by it, though the gods hear, I hopeThey'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?CAIUS LUCIUSThy name?IMOGENFidele, sir.CAIUS LUCIUSThou dost approve thyself the very same:Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.Wilt take thy chance with me?

The Roman emperor's letters,Sent by a consul to me, should not soonerThan thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.IMOGENI'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,I'll hide my master from the flies, as deepAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and whenWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,And on it said a century of prayers,Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;And leaving so his service, follow you,So please you entertain me.CAIUS LUCIUSAy, good youth!And rather father thee than master thee.My friends,The boy hath taught us manly duties: let usFind out the prettiest daisied plot we can,And make him with our pikes and partisansA grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'dBy thee to us, and he shall be interr'dAs soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyesSome falls are means the happier to arise.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and AttendantsCYMBELINEAgain; and bring me word how 'tis with her.Exit an AttendantA fever with the absence of her son,A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,The great part of my comfort, gone; my queenUpon a desperate bed, and in a timeWhen fearful wars point at me; her son gone,So needful for this present: it strikes me, pastThe hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,Who needs must know of her departure andDost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from theeBy a sharp torture.PISANIOSir, my life is yours;I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,I nothing know where she remains, why gone,Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,Hold me your loyal servant.First LordGood my liege,The day that she was missing he was here:I dare be bound he's true and shall performAll parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,There wants no diligence in seeking him,And will, no doubt, be found.CYMBELINEThe time is troublesome.To PISANIOWe'll slip you for a season; but our jealousyDoes yet depend.First LordSo please your majesty,The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,Are landed on your coast, with a supplyOf Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.CYMBELINENow for the counsel of my son and queen!I am amazed with matter.First LordGood my liege,Your preparation can affront no lessThan what you hear of: come more, for moreyou're ready:The want is but to put those powers in motionThat long to move.CYMBELINEI thank you. Let's withdraw;And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear notWhat can from Italy annoy us; butWe grieve at chances here. Away!Exeunt all but PISANIOPISANIOI heard no letter from my master sinceI wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:Nor hear I from my mistress who did promiseTo yield me often tidings: neither know IWhat is betid to Cloten; but remainPerplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.These present wars shall find I love my country,Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.ExitSCENE IV.

This way, the RomansMust or for Britons slay us, or receive usFor barbarous and unnatural revoltsDuring their use, and slay us after.BELARIUSSons,We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.To the king's party there's no going: newnessOf Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'dAmong the bands--may drive us to a renderWhere we have lived, and so extort from's thatWhich we have done, whose answer would be deathDrawn on with torture.GUIDERIUSThis is, sir, a doubtIn such a time nothing becoming you,Nor satisfying us.ARVIRAGUSIt is not likelyThat when they hear the Roman horses neigh,Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyesAnd ears so cloy'd importantly as now,That they will waste their time upon our note,To know from whence we are.BELARIUSO, I am knownOf many in the army: many years,Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore himFrom my remembrance. And, besides, the kingHath not deserved my service nor your loves;Who find in my exile the want of breeding,The certainty of this hard life; aye hopelessTo have the courtesy your cradle promised,But to be still hot summer's tamings andThe shrinking slaves of winter.GUIDERIUSThan be soBetter to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:I and my brother are not known; yourselfSo out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,Cannot be question'd.ARVIRAGUSBy this sun that shines,I'll thither: what thing is it that I neverDid see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!Never bestrid a horse, save one that hadA rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowelNor iron on his heel! I am ashamedTo look upon the holy sun, to haveThe benefit of his blest beams, remainingSo long a poor unknown.GUIDERIUSBy heavens, I'll go:If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,I'll take the better care, but if you will not,The hazard therefore due fall on me byThe hands of Romans!ARVIRAGUSSo say I amen.BELARIUSNo reason I, since of your lives you setSo slight a valuation, should reserveMy crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!If in your country wars you chance to die,That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:Lead, lead.AsideThe time seems long; their bloodthinks scorn,Till it fly out and show them princes born.ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

O Pisanio!Every good servant does not all commands:No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if youShould have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I neverHad lived to put on this: so had you savedThe noble Imogen to repent, and struckMe, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,To have them fall no more: you some permitTo second ills with ills, each elder worse,And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,And make me blest to obey! I am brought hitherAmong the Italian gentry, and to fightAgainst my lady's kingdom: 'tis enoughThat, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe meOf these Italian weeds and suit myselfAs does a Briton peasant: so I'll fightAgainst the part I come with; so I'll dieFor thee, O Imogen, even for whom my lifeIs every breath a death; and thus, unknown,Pitied nor hated, to the face of perilMyself I'll dedicate. Let me make men knowMore valour in me than my habits show.Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!To shame the guise o' the world, I will beginThe fashion, less without and more within.ExitSCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army: from the other side, the British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves himIACHIMOThe heaviness and guilt within my bosomTakes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,The princess of this country, and the air on'tRevengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,A very drudge of nature's, have subdued meIn my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borneAs I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.If that thy gentry, Britain, go beforeThis lout as he exceeds our lords, the oddsIs that we scarce are men and you are gods.ExitThe battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSBELARIUSStand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;The lane is guarded: nothing routs us butThe villany of our fears.GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUSStand, stand, and fight!Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGENCAIUS LUCIUSAway, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;For friends kill friends, and the disorder's suchAs war were hoodwink'd.IACHIMO'Tis their fresh supplies.CAIUS LUCIUSIt is a day turn'd strangely: or betimesLet's reinforce, or fly.ExeuntSCENE III. Another part of the field.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British LordLordCamest thou from where they made the stand?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI did.Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.LordI did.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNo blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,But that the heavens fought: the king himselfOf his wings destitute, the army broken,And but the backs of Britons seen, all flyingThrough a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having workMore plentiful than tools to do't, struck downSome mortally, some slightly touch'd, some fallingMerely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'dWith dead men hurt behind, and cowards livingTo die with lengthen'd shame.LordWhere was this lane?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSClose by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,An honest one, I warrant; who deservedSo long a breeding as his white beard came to,In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,He, with two striplings-lads more like to runThe country base than to commit such slaughterWith faces fit for masks, or rather fairerThan those for preservation cased, or shame--Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;Or we are Romans and will give you thatLike beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'These three,Three thousand confident, in act as many--For three performers are the file when allThe rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'Accommodated by the place, more charmingWith their own nobleness, which could have turn'dA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,turn'd cowardBut by example--O, a sin in war,Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to lookThe way that they did, and to grin like lionsUpon the pikes o' the hunters. Then beganA stop i' the chaser, a retire, anonA rout, confusion thick; forthwith they flyChickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,Like fragments in hard voyages, becameThe life o' the need: having found the backdoor openOf the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!Some slain before; some dying; some their friendsO'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:Those that would die or ere resist are grownThe mortal bugs o' the field.LordThis was strange chanceA narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNay, do not wonder at it: you are madeRather to wonder at the things you hearThan to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'LordNay, be not angry, sir.POSTHUMUS LEONATUS'Lack, to what end?Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;For if he'll do as he is made to do,I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.You have put me into rhyme.LordFarewell; you're angry.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSStill going?Exit LordThis is a lord! O noble misery,To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!To-day how many would have given their honoursTo have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,Could not find death where I did hear him groan,Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,Sweet words; or hath more ministers than weThat draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find himFor being now a favourer to the Briton,No more a Briton, I have resumed againThe part I came in: fight I will no more,But yield me to the veriest hind that shallOnce touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter isHere made by the Roman; great the answer beBritons must take. For me, my ransom's death;On either side I come to spend my breath;Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,But end it by some means for Imogen.Enter two British Captains and SoldiersFirst CaptainGreat Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.Second CaptainThere was a fourth man, in a silly habit,That gave the affront with them.First CaptainSo 'tis reported:But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSA Roman,Who had not now been drooping here, if secondsHad answer'd him.Second CaptainLay hands on him; a dog!A leg of Rome shall not return to tellWhat crows have peck'd them here. He bragshis serviceAs if he were of note: bring him to the king.Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives. The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnesSCENE IV. A British prison.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two GaolersFirst GaolerYou shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;So graze as you find pasture.Second GaolerAy, or a stomach.Exeunt GaolersPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSMost welcome, bondage! for thou art away,think, to liberty: yet am I betterThan one that's sick o' the gout; since he had ratherGroan so in perpetuity than be curedBy the sure physician, death, who is the keyTo unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'dMore than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give meThe penitent instrument to pick that bolt,Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?So children temporal fathers do appease;Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?I cannot do it better than in gyves,Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,If of my freedom 'tis the main part, takeNo stricter render of me than my all.I know you are more clement than vile men,Who of their broken debtors take a third,A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive againOn their abatement: that's not my desire:For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,If you will take this audit, take this life,And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!I'll speak to thee in silence.SleepsSolemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus, an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them: then, after other music, follow the two young Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleepingSicilius LeonatusNo more, thou thunder-master, showThy spite on mortal flies:With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,That thy adulteriesRates and revenges.Hath my poor boy done aught but well,Whose face I never saw?I died whilst in the womb he stay'dAttending nature's law:Whose father then, as men reportThou orphans' father art,Thou shouldst have been, and shielded himFrom this earth-vexing smart.MotherLucina lent not me her aid,But took me in my throes;That from me was Posthumus ript,Came crying 'mongst his foes,A thing of pity!Sicilius LeonatusGreat nature, like his ancestry,Moulded the stuff so fair,That he deserved the praise o' the world,As great Sicilius' heir.First BrotherWhen once he was mature for man,In Britain where was heThat could stand up his parallel;Or fruitful object beIn eye of Imogen, that bestCould deem his dignity?MotherWith marriage wherefore was he mock'd,To be exiled, and thrownFrom Leonati seat, and castFrom her his dearest one,Sweet Imogen?Sicilius LeonatusWhy did you suffer Iachimo,Slight thing of Italy,To taint his nobler heart and brainWith needless jealosy;And to become the geck and scornO' th' other's villany?Second BrotherFor this from stiller seats we came,Our parents and us twain,That striking in our country's causeFell bravely and were slain,Our fealty and Tenantius' rightWith honour to maintain.First BrotherLike hardiment Posthumus hathTo Cymbeline perform'd:Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,Why hast thou thus adjourn'dThe graces for his merits due,Being all to dolours turn'd?Sicilius LeonatusThy crystal window ope; look out;No longer exerciseUpon a valiant race thy harshAnd potent injuries.MotherSince, Jupiter, our son is good,Take off his miseries.Sicilius LeonatusPeep through thy marble mansion; help;Or we poor ghosts will cryTo the shining synod of the restAgainst thy deity.First Brother Second BrotherHelp, Jupiter; or we appeal,And from thy justice fly.Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their kneesJupiterNo more, you petty spirits of region low,Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghostsAccuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and restUpon your never-withering banks of flowers:Be not with mortal accidents opprest;No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and inOur temple was he married. Rise, and fade.He shall be lord of lady Imogen,And happier much by his affliction made.This tablet lay upon his breast, whereinOur pleasure his full fortune doth confine:and so, away: no further with your dinExpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.AscendsSicilius LeonatusHe came in thunder; his celestial breathWas sulphurous to smell: the holy eagleStoop'd as to foot us: his ascension isMore sweet than our blest fields: his royal birdPrunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,As when his god is pleased.AllThanks, Jupiter!Sicilius LeonatusThe marble pavement closes, he is enter'dHis radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,Let us with care perform his great behest.The Apparitions vanishPosthumus Leonatus[Waking] Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begotA father to me; and thou hast createdA mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:And so I am awake. Poor wretches that dependOn greatness' favour dream as I have done,Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:Many dream not to find, neither deserve,And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,That have this golden chance and know not why.What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!Be not, as is our fangled world, a garmentNobler than that it covers: let thy effectsSo follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,As good as promise.Reads'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece oftender air; and when from a stately cedar shall belopped branches, which, being dead many years,shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock andfreshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.''Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmenTongue and brain not; either both or nothing;Or senseless speaking or a speaking suchAs sense cannot untie. Be what it is,The action of my life is like it, whichI'll keep, if but for sympathy.Re-enter First GaolerFirst GaolerCome, sir, are you ready for death?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSOver-roasted rather; ready long ago.First GaolerHanging is the word, sir: ifyou be ready for that, you are well cooked.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSo, if I prove a good repast to thespectators, the dish pays the shot.First GaolerA heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,you shall be called to no more payments, fear nomore tavern-bills; which are often the sadness ofparting, as the procuring of mirth: you come inflint for want of meat, depart reeling with toomuch drink; sorry that you have paid too much, andsorry that you are paid too much; purse and brainboth empty; the brain the heavier for being toolight, the purse too light, being drawn ofheaviness: of this contradiction you shall now bequit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums upthousands in a trice: you have no true debitor andcreditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book andcounters; so the acquittance follows.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI am merrier to die than thou art to live.First GaolerIndeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not thetooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep yoursleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think hewould change places with his officer; for, look you,sir, you know not which way you shall go.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYes, indeed do I, fellow.First GaolerYour death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seenhim so pictured: you must either be directed bysome that take upon them to know, or do take uponyourself that which I am sure you do not know, orjump the after inquiry on your own peril: and howyou shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'llnever return to tell one.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes todirect them the way I am going, but such as wink andwill not use them.First GaolerWhat an infinite mock is this, that a man shouldhave the best use of eyes to see the way ofblindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.Enter a MessengerMessengerKnock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.First GaolerI'll be hang'd then.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and MessengerFirst GaolerUnless a man would marry a gallows and beget younggibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on myconscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,for all he be a Roman: and there be some of themtoo that die against their wills; so should I, if Iwere one. I would we were all of one mind, and onemind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers andgallowses! I speak against my present profit, butmy wish hath a preferment in 't.ExeuntSCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and AttendantsCYMBELINEStand by my side, you whom the gods have madePreservers of my throne. Woe is my heartThat the poor soldier that so richly fought,Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breastStepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:He shall be happy that can find him, ifOur grace can make him so.BELARIUSI never sawSuch noble fury in so poor a thing;Such precious deeds in one that promises noughtBut beggary and poor looks.CYMBELINENo tidings of him?PISANIOHe hath been search'd among the dead and living,But no trace of him.CYMBELINETo my grief, I amThe heir of his reward;To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSwhich I will addTo you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the timeTo ask of whence you are. Report it.BELARIUSSir,In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:Further to boast were neither true nor modest,Unless I add, we are honest.CYMBELINEBow your knees.Arise my knights o' the battle: I create youCompanions to our person and will fit youWith dignities becoming your estates.Enter CORNELIUS and LadiesThere's business in these faces. Why so sadlyGreet you our victory? you look like Romans,And not o' the court of Britain.CORNELIUSHail, great king!To sour your happiness, I must reportThe queen is dead.CYMBELINEWho worse than a physicianWould this report become? But I consider,By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet deathWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?CORNELIUSWith horror, madly dying, like her life,Which, being cruel to the world, concludedMost cruel to herself. What she confess'dI will report, so please you: these her womenCan trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeksWere present when she finish'd.CYMBELINEPrithee, say.CORNELIUSFirst, she confess'd she never loved you, onlyAffected greatness got by you, not you:Married your royalty, was wife to your place;Abhorr'd your person.CYMBELINEShe alone knew this;And, but she spoke it dying, I would notBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.CORNELIUSYour daughter, whom she bore in hand to loveWith such integrity, she did confessWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,But that her flight prevented it, she hadTa'en off by poison.CYMBELINEO most delicate fiend!Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?CORNELIUSMore, sir, and worse. She did confess she hadFor you a mortal mineral; which, being took,Should by the minute feed on life and lingeringBy inches waste you: in which time she purposed,By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, toO'ercome you with her show, and in time,When she had fitted you with her craft, to workHer son into the adoption of the crown:But, failing of her end by his strange absence,Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despiteOf heaven and men, her purposes; repentedThe evils she hatch'd were not effected; soDespairing died.CYMBELINEHeard you all this, her women?First LadyWe did, so please your highness.CYMBELINEMine eyesWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,That thought her like her seeming; it hadbeen viciousTo have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGENThou comest not, Caius, now for tribute thatThe Britons have razed out, though with the lossOf many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suitThat their good souls may be appeased with slaughterOf you their captives, which ourself have granted:So think of your estate.CAIUS LUCIUSConsider, sir, the chance of war: the dayWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,We should not, when the blood was cool,have threaten'dOur prisoners with the sword. But since the godsWill have it thus, that nothing but our livesMay be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficethA Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:Augustus lives to think on't: and so muchFor my peculiar care. This one thing onlyI will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,Let him be ransom'd: never master hadA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,So tender over his occasions, true,So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue joinWith my request, which I make bold your highnessCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,And spare no blood beside.CYMBELINEI have surely seen him:His favour is familiar to me. Boy,Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,The noblest ta'en.IMOGENI humbly thank your highness.CAIUS LUCIUSI do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;And yet I know thou wilt.IMOGENNo, no: alack,There's other work in hand: I see a thingBitter to me as death: your life, good master,Must shuffle for itself.CAIUS LUCIUSThe boy disdains me,He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joysThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.Why stands he so perplex'd?CYMBELINEWhat wouldst thou, boy?I love thee more and more: think more and moreWhat's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?IMOGENHe is a Roman; no more kin to meThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,Am something nearer.CYMBELINEWherefore eyest him so?IMOGENI'll tell you, sir, in private, if you pleaseTo give me hearing.CYMBELINEAy, with all my heart,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?IMOGENFidele, sir.CYMBELINEThou'rt my good youth, my page;I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apartBELARIUSIs not this boy revived from death?ARVIRAGUSOne sand anotherNot more resembles that sweet rosy ladWho died, and was Fidele. What think you?GUIDERIUSThe same dead thing alive.BELARIUSPeace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sureHe would have spoke to us.GUIDERIUSBut we saw him dead.BELARIUSBe silent; let's see further.PISANIO[Aside] It is my mistress:Since she is living, let the time run onTo good or bad.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forwardCYMBELINECome, stand thou by our side;Make thy demand aloud.To IACHIMOSir, step you forth;Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,Which is our honour, bitter torture shallWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.IMOGENMy boon is, that this gentleman may renderOf whom he had this ring.POSTHUMUS LEONATUS[Aside] What's that to him?CYMBELINEThat diamond upon your finger, sayHow came it yours?IACHIMOThou'lt torture me to leave unspoken thatWhich, to be spoke, would torture thee.CYMBELINEHow! me?IACHIMOI am glad to be constrain'd to utter thatWhich torments me to conceal. By villanyI got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;Whom thou didst banish; and--which more maygrieve thee,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?CYMBELINEAll that belongs to this.IACHIMOThat paragon, thy daughter,--For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spiritsQuail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.CYMBELINEMy daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:I had rather thou shouldst live while nature willThan die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.IACHIMOUpon a time,--unhappy was the clockThat struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursedThe mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, wouldOur viands had been poison'd, or at leastThose which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--What should I say? he was too good to beWhere ill men were; and was the best of allAmongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,Hearing us praise our loves of ItalyFor beauty that made barren the swell'd boastOf him that best could speak, for feature, lamingThe shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,A shop of all the qualities that manLoves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,Fairness which strikes the eye--CYMBELINEI stand on fire:Come to the matter.IACHIMOAll too soon I shall,Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,Most like a noble lord in love and oneThat had a royal lover, took his hint;And, not dispraising whom we praised,--thereinHe was as calm as virtue--he beganHis mistress' picture; which by his tonguebeing made,And then a mind put in't, either our bragsWere crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his descriptionProved us unspeaking sots.CYMBELINENay, nay, to the purpose.IACHIMOYour daughter's chastity--there it begins.He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with himPieces of gold 'gainst this which then he woreUpon his honour'd finger, to attainIn suit the place of's bed and win this ringBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,No lesser of her honour confidentThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;And would so, had it been a carbuncleOf Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had itBeen all the worth of's car. Away to BritainPost I in this design: well may you, sir,Remember me at court; where I was taughtOf your chaste daughter the wide difference'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'dOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain'Gan in your duller Britain operateMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent:And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,That I return'd with simular proof enoughTo make the noble Leonatus mad,By wounding his belief in her renownWith tokens thus, and thus; averting notesOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marksOf secret on her person, that he could notBut think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--Methinks, I see him now--POSTHUMUS LEONATUS[Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,Egregious murderer, thief, any thingThat's due to all the villains past, in being,To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send outFor torturers ingenious: it is IThat all the abhorred things o' the earth amendBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--That caused a lesser villain than myself,A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the templeOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, setThe dogs o' the street to bay me: every villainBe call'd Posthumus Leonitus; andBe villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,Imogen, Imogen!IMOGENPeace, my lord; hear, hear--POSTHUMUS LEONATUSShall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,There lie thy part.Striking her: she fallsPISANIOO, gentlemen, help!Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!Mine honour'd lady!CYMBELINEDoes the world go round?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSHow come these staggers on me?PISANIOWake, my mistress!CYMBELINEIf this be so, the gods do mean to strike meTo death with mortal joy.PISANIOHow fares thy mistress?IMOGENO, get thee from my sight;Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!Breathe not where princes are.CYMBELINEThe tune of Imogen!PISANIOLady,The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, ifThat box I gave you was not thought by meA precious thing: I had it from the queen.CYMBELINENew matter still?IMOGENIt poison'd me.CORNELIUSO gods!I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.Which must approve thee honest: 'If PisanioHave,' said she, 'given his mistress that confectionWhich I gave him for cordial, she is servedAs I would serve a rat.'CYMBELINEWhat's this, Comelius?CORNELIUSThe queen, sir, very oft importuned meTo temper poisons for her, still pretendingThe satisfaction of her knowledge onlyIn killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purposeWas of more danger, did compound for herA certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would ceaseThe present power of life, but in short timeAll offices of nature should againDo their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?IMOGENMost like I did, for I was dead.BELARIUSMy boys,There was our error.GUIDERIUSThis is, sure, Fidele.IMOGENWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?Think that you are upon a rock; and nowThrow me again.Embracing himPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSHang there like a fruit, my soul,Till the tree die!CYMBELINEHow now, my flesh, my child!What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?Wilt thou not speak to me?IMOGEN[Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.BELARIUS[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did lovethis youth, I blame ye not:You had a motive for't.CYMBELINEMy tears that fallProve holy water on thee! Imogen,Thy mother's dead.IMOGENI am sorry for't, my lord.CYMBELINEO, she was nought; and long of her it wasThat we meet here so strangely: but her sonIs gone, we know not how nor where.PISANIOMy lord,Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,Upon my lady's missing, came to meWith his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,If I discover'd not which way she was gone,It was my instant death. By accident,had a feigned letter of my master'sThen in my pocket; which directed himTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,Which he enforced from me, away he postsWith unchaste purpose and with oath to violateMy lady's honour: what became of himI further know not.GUIDERIUSLet me end the story:I slew him there.CYMBELINEMarry, the gods forfend!I would not thy good deeds should from my lipsPluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,Deny't again.GUIDERIUSI have spoke it, and I did it.CYMBELINEHe was a prince.GUIDERIUSA most incivil one: the wrongs he did meWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke meWith language that would make me spurn the sea,If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;And am right glad he is not standing hereTo tell this tale of mine.CYMBELINEI am sorry for thee:By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and mustEndure our law: thou'rt dead.IMOGENThat headless manI thought had been my lord.CYMBELINEBind the offender,And take him from our presence.BELARIUSStay, sir king:This man is better than the man he slew,As well descended as thyself; and hathMore of thee merited than a band of ClotensHad ever scar for.To the GuardLet his arms alone;They were not born for bondage.CYMBELINEWhy, old soldier,Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,By tasting of our wrath? How of descentAs good as we?ARVIRAGUSIn that he spake too far.CYMBELINEAnd thou shalt die for't.BELARIUSWe will die all three:But I will prove that two on's are as goodAs I have given out him. My sons, I must,For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,Though, haply, well for you.ARVIRAGUSYour danger's ours.GUIDERIUSAnd our good his.BELARIUSHave at it then, by leave.Thou hadst, great king, a subject whoWas call'd Belarius.CYMBELINEWhat of him? he isA banish'd traitor.BELARIUSHe it is that hathAssumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;I know not how a traitor.CYMBELINETake him hence:The whole world shall not save him.BELARIUSNot too hot:First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;And let it be confiscate all, so soonAs I have received it.CYMBELINENursing of my sons!BELARIUSI am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,These two young gentlemen, that call me fatherAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;They are the issue of your loins, my liege,And blood of your begetting.CYMBELINEHow! my issue!BELARIUSSo sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishmentItself, and all my treason; that I suffer'dWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes--For such and so they are--these twenty yearsHave I train'd up: those arts they have as ICould put into them; my breeding was, sir, asYour highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these childrenUpon my banishment: I moved her to't,Having received the punishment before,For that which I did then: beaten for loyaltyExcited me to treason: their dear loss,The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shapedUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,Here are your sons again; and I must loseTwo of the sweet'st companions in the world.The benediction of these covering heavensFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthyTo inlay heaven with stars.CYMBELINEThou weep'st, and speak'st.The service that you three have done is moreUnlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:If these be they, I know not how to wishA pair of worthier sons.BELARIUSBe pleased awhile.This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'dIn a most curious mantle, wrought by the handOf his queen mother, which for more probationI can with ease produce.CYMBELINEGuiderius hadUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;It was a mark of wonder.BELARIUSThis is he;Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:It was wise nature's end in the donation,To be his evidence now.CYMBELINEO, what, am IA mother to the birth of three? Ne'er motherRejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,That, after this strange starting from your orbs,may reign in them now! O Imogen,Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.IMOGENNo, my lord;I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,Have we thus met? O, never say hereafterBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,When I was but your sister; I you brothers,When ye were so indeed.CYMBELINEDid you e'er meet?ARVIRAGUSAy, my good lord.GUIDERIUSAnd at first meeting loved;Continued so, until we thought he died.CORNELIUSBy the queen's dram she swallow'd.CYMBELINEO rare instinct!When shall I hear all through? This fierceabridgementHath to it circumstantial branches, whichDistinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?And when came you to serve our Roman captive?How parted with your brothers? how first met them?Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,And your three motives to the battle, withI know not how much more, should be demanded;And all the other by-dependencies,From chance to chance: but nor the time nor placeWill serve our long inter'gatories. See,Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eyeOn him, her brother, me, her master, hittingEach object with a joy: the counterchangeIs severally in all. Let's quit this ground,And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.To BELARIUSThou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.IMOGENYou are my father too, and did relieve me,To see this gracious season.CYMBELINEAll o'erjoy'd,Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,For they shall taste our comfort.IMOGENMy good master,I will yet do you service.CAIUS LUCIUSHappy be you!CYMBELINEThe forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,He would have well becomed this place, and gracedThe thankings of a king.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI am, sir,The soldier that did company these threeIn poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment forThe purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and mightHave made you finish.IACHIMO[Kneeling] I am down again:But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,Which I so often owe: but your ring first;And here the bracelet of the truest princessThat ever swore her faith.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSKneel not to me:The power that I have on you is, to spare you;The malice towards you to forgive you: live,And deal with others better.CYMBELINENobly doom'd!We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;Pardon's the word to all.ARVIRAGUSYou holp us, sir,As you did mean indeed to be our brother;Joy'd are we that you are.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYour servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methoughtGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,Appear'd to me, with other spritely showsOf mine own kindred: when I waked, I foundThis label on my bosom; whose containingIs so from sense in hardness, that I canMake no collection of it: let him showHis skill in the construction.CAIUS LUCIUSPhilarmonus!SoothsayerHere, my good lord.CAIUS LUCIUSRead, and declare the meaning.Soothsayer[Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himselfunknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by apiece of tender air; and when from a stately cedarshall be lopped branches, which, being dead manyyears, shall after revive, be jointed to the oldstock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus endhis miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish inpeace and plenty.'Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;The fit and apt construction of thy name,Being Leonatus, doth import so much.To CYMBELINEThe piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divineIs this most constant wife; who, even now,Answering the letter of the oracle,Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd aboutWith this most tender air.CYMBELINEThis hath some seeming.SoothsayerThe lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches pointThy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,For many years thought dead, are now revived,To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issuePromises Britain peace and plenty.CYMBELINEWellMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,And to the Roman empire; promisingTo pay our wonted tribute, from the whichWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen;Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,Have laid most heavy hand.SoothsayerThe fingers of the powers above do tuneThe harmony of this peace. The visionWhich I made known to Lucius, ere the strokeOf this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instantIs full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,From south to west on wing soaring aloft,Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sunSo vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,The imperial Caesar, should again uniteHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,Which shines here in the west.CYMBELINELaud we the gods;And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrilsFrom our blest altars. Publish we this peaceTo all our subjects. Set we forward: letA Roman and a British ensign waveFriendly together: so through Lud's-town march:And in the temple of great JupiterOur peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.Set on there! Never was a war did cease,Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.Exeunt
